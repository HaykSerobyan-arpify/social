  "1Samuel-1-3": "3\u00a0Every year Elkanah left his town of Ramah and went up to Shiloh. He worshiped the Lord All-Powerful at Shiloh and offered sacrifices to the Lord there. Shiloh was where Eli\u2019s sons, Hophni and Phinehas, served as priests of the Lord.",
  "1Samuel-1-4": "4\u00a0Whenever Elkanah offered his sacrifices, he always gave one share of the food to his wife Peninnah and a share of the food to each of Peninnah\u2019s children.",

  "1Samuel-1-25": "25\u00a0They went before the Lord. Elkanah killed the bull as a sacrifice to the Lord as he usually did.[i] Then Hannah gave the boy to Eli.",

  "1Samuel-17-44": "44\u00a0He said to David, \u201cCome here, and I\u2019ll feed your body to the birds and wild animals.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-17-45": "45\u00a0David said to the Philistine, \u201cYou come to me using sword, spear, and javelin. But I come to you in the name of the Lord All-Powerful, the God of the armies of Israel. You have said bad things about him.",
  "1Samuel-17-46": "46\u00a0Today the Lord will let me defeat you. I will kill you. I will cut off your head and feed your body to the birds and wild animals. And we will do the same thing to all the other Philistines too. Then all the world will know there is a God in Israel.",
  "1Samuel-17-47": "47\u00a0All the people gathered here will know that the Lord doesn\u2019t need swords or spears to save people. The battle belongs to the Lord, and he will help us defeat all of you.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-17-48": "48\u00a0Goliath the Philistine started to attack David. He slowly walked closer and closer toward David, but David ran out to meet Goliath.",
  "1Samuel-17-49": "49\u00a0David took out a stone from his bag. He put it in his sling and swung the sling. The stone flew from the sling and hit Goliath right between the eyes. The stone sank deep into his head, and Goliath fell to the ground\u2014face down.",
  "1Samuel-17-50": "50\u00a0So David defeated the Philistine with only a sling and one stone! He hit the Philistine and killed him. David didn\u2019t have a sword,",
  "1Samuel-17-51": "51\u00a0so he ran and stood beside the Philistine. Then David took Goliath\u2019s own sword out of its sheath and used it to cut off his head. That is how David killed the Philistine.\u00a0When the other Philistines saw their hero was dead, they turned and ran.",
  "1Samuel-17-52": "52\u00a0The soldiers of Israel and Judah shouted and started chasing the Philistines. The Israelites chased them all the way to the city limits of Gath and to the gates of Ekron. They killed many of the Philistines. Their bodies were scattered along the Shaaraim road all the way to Gath and Ekron.",
  "1Samuel-17-53": "53\u00a0After chasing the Philistines, the Israelites came back to the Philistine camp and took many things from that camp.",
  "1Samuel-17-54": "54\u00a0David took the Philistine\u2019s head to Jerusalem, but he kept the Philistine\u2019s weapons at home.",
  "1Samuel-17-55": "Saul Begins to Fear David\u00a055\u00a0Saul watched David go out to fight Goliath. Saul spoke to Abner, the commander of the army. \u201cAbner, who is that young man\u2019s father?\u201d\u00a0Abner answered, \u201cI swear I don\u2019t know, sir.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-17-56": "56\u00a0King Saul said, \u201cFind out who his father is.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-17-57": "57\u00a0When David came back after killing Goliath, Abner brought him to Saul. David was still holding the Philistine\u2019s head.",
  "1Samuel-17-58": "58\u00a0Saul asked him, \u201cYoung man, who is your father?\u201d\u00a0David answered, \u201cI am the son of your servant Jesse, from Bethlehem.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-18-1-1Sam-18-2": "David and Jonathan Become Friends\u00a018\u00a0Saul decided to take David with him. He would not let David go back home to his father. After David finished talking with Saul, Jonathan developed a strong friendship with David.[a]",
  "1Samuel-18-3": "3\u00a0Jonathan loved David as much as himself, so they made a special agreement.",
  "1Samuel-18-4": "4\u00a0Jonathan took off the coat he was wearing and gave it to David. In fact, Jonathan gave David his whole uniform\u2014including his sword, his bow, and even his belt.",
  "1Samuel-18-5": "Saul Notices David\u2019s Success\u00a05\u00a0David went to fight wherever Saul sent him. He was very successful, so Saul put him in charge of the soldiers. This pleased everyone, even Saul\u2019s officers.",
  "1Samuel-18-6": "6\u00a0David would go out to fight against the Philistines. On the way home, after the battles, women in every town in Israel would come out to meet him. They sang and danced for joy as they played their tambourines and lyres. They did this right in front of Saul!",
  "1Samuel-18-7": "7\u00a0The women sang,\u00a0\u201cSaul has killed his thousands,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0but David has killed tens of thousands.\u201d\u00a0but David has killed tens of thousands.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-18-8": "8\u00a0This song upset Saul and he became very angry. Saul thought, \u201cThe women give David credit for killing tens of thousands of the enemy, and they give me credit for only thousands. A little more of this and they will give him the kingdom itself![b]\u201d",
  "1Samuel-18-9": "9\u00a0So from that time on, Saul watched David very closely.",
  "1Samuel-18-10": "Saul Is Afraid of David\u00a010\u00a0The next day, an evil spirit from God took control of Saul and he went wild[c] in his house. David played the harp to calm him as he usually did,",
  "1Samuel-18-11": "11\u00a0but Saul had a spear in his hand. He thought, \u201cI\u2019ll pin David to the wall.\u201d Saul threw the spear twice, but David jumped out of the way both times.",
  "1Samuel-18-12": "12\u00a0The Lord had left Saul and was now with David, so Saul was afraid of David.",
  "1Samuel-18-13": "13\u00a0Saul sent David away and made him a commander over 1000 soldiers. This put David out among the men even more as they went into battle and returned.",
  "1Samuel-18-14": "14\u00a0The Lord was with David, so he was successful in everything.",
  "1Samuel-18-15": "15\u00a0Saul saw how successful David was and became even more afraid of him.",
  "1Samuel-18-16": "16\u00a0But all the people in Israel and Judah loved David because he was out among them and led them into battle.",
  "1Samuel-18-17": "Saul Wants His Daughter to Marry David\u00a017\u00a0One day Saul said to David, \u201cHere is my oldest daughter, Merab. I will let you marry her. Then you will be like a son to me and you will be a real soldier.[d] Then you will go and fight the Lord\u2019s battles.\u201d Saul was really thinking, \u201cNow I won\u2019t have to kill David. I will let the Philistines kill him for me.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-18-18": "18\u00a0But David said, \u201cI am not an important man from an important family. I can\u2019t marry the king\u2019s daughter.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-18-19": "19\u00a0So when the time came for David to marry Saul\u2019s daughter, Saul let her marry Adriel from Meholah.",
  "1Samuel-18-20": "20\u00a0People told Saul that his daughter Michal loved David. This made Saul happy.",
  "1Samuel-18-21": "21\u00a0He thought, \u201cI will use Michal to trap David. I will let Michal marry David, and then I will let the Philistines kill him.\u201d So Saul said to David a second time, \u201cYou can marry my daughter today.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-18-22": "22\u00a0Saul commanded his officers to speak to David in private. He told them to say, \u201cLook, the king likes you. His officers like you. You should marry his daughter.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-18-23": "23\u00a0Saul\u2019s officers said these things to David, but David answered, \u201cDo you think it is easy to become the king\u2019s son-in-law? I am just a poor, ordinary man.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-18-24": "24\u00a0Saul\u2019s officers told Saul what David said.",
  "1Samuel-18-25": "25\u00a0Saul told them, \u201cSay this to David, \u2018David, the king doesn\u2019t want you to pay money for his daughter.[e] He wants to get even with his enemy, so the price for marrying his daughter is 100 Philistine foreskins.\u2019\u201d That was Saul\u2019s secret plan. He thought the Philistines would kill David.",
  "1Samuel-18-26": "26\u00a0Saul\u2019s officers told this to David. David was happy that he had a chance to become the king\u2019s son-in-law, so immediately",
  "1Samuel-18-27": "27\u00a0he and his men went out to fight the Philistines. They killed 200[f] Philistines. David took these Philistine foreskins and gave them to Saul. He did this because he wanted to become the king\u2019s son-in-law.\u00a0Saul let David marry his daughter Michal.",
  "1Samuel-18-28": "28\u00a0He saw that the Lord was with David and he also saw that his daughter, Michal, loved David.",
  "1Samuel-18-29": "29\u00a0So Saul became even more afraid of David and was against him all that time.",
  "1Samuel-18-30": "30\u00a0The Philistine commanders continued to go out to fight the Israelites, but David defeated them every time. He became famous as Saul\u2019s best officer.",
  "1Samuel-19-1": "Jonathan Helps David\u00a019\u00a0Saul told his son Jonathan and his officers to kill David. But Jonathan liked David very much,",
  "1Samuel-19-2-1Sam-19-3": "2-3\u00a0so he warned him. \u201cBe careful! Saul is looking for a chance to kill you. In the morning go into the field and hide. I will go out into the field with my father. We will stand in the field where you are hiding. I will talk to my father about you, and I will tell you what I learn.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-19-4": "4\u00a0Jonathan talked to his father Saul. Jonathan said good things about David. He said, \u201cYou are the king. David is your servant. David hasn\u2019t done anything wrong to you, so don\u2019t do anything wrong to him. He has always been good to you.",
  "1Samuel-19-5": "5\u00a0He risked his life when he killed the Philistine. The Lord won a great victory for all Israel. You saw it, and you were happy. Why do you want to hurt David? He\u2019s innocent. There is no reason to kill him.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-19-6": "6\u00a0Saul listened to Jonathan and made a promise. He said, \u201cAs surely as the Lord lives, David won\u2019t be put to death.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-19-7": "7\u00a0So Jonathan called David and told him everything that was said. Then Jonathan brought David to Saul, and David was with Saul as before.",
  "1Samuel-19-8": "Saul Tries Again to Kill David\u00a08\u00a0Once again there was war with the Philistines, and David went out to fight. He defeated them badly, and they ran away.",
  "1Samuel-19-9": "9\u00a0Later, in Saul\u2019s house, David was playing the harp. Saul was there with his spear in his hand. Then an evil spirit from the Lord came on Saul.",
  "1Samuel-19-10": "10\u00a0Saul threw his spear at David and tried to pin him to the wall. David jumped out of the way, so the spear missed him and stuck in the wall. That night, David ran away.",
  "1Samuel-19-11": "11\u00a0Saul sent men to watch David\u2019s house. They stayed there all night. They were waiting to kill David in the morning, but David\u2019s wife Michal warned him. She said, \u201cYou must run away tonight and save your life. If you don\u2019t, you will be killed tomorrow.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-19-12": "12\u00a0Then Michal let David down out of a window, and he escaped and ran away.",
  "1Samuel-19-13": "13\u00a0Michal took the household god, put clothes on it, and put goats\u2019 hair on its head. Then she put the statue in the bed.",
  "1Samuel-19-14": "14\u00a0Saul sent messengers to take David prisoner. But Michal said, \u201cDavid is sick.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-19-15": "15\u00a0The men went and told Saul, but he sent the messengers back to see David. Saul told these men, \u201cBring David to me. Bring him lying on his bed if you must, even if it kills him.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-19-16": "16\u00a0The messengers went to David\u2019s house. They went inside to get him, but they saw it was only a statue and that its hair was only goats\u2019 hair.",
  "1Samuel-19-17": "17\u00a0Saul said to Michal, \u201cWhy did you trick me like this? You let my enemy escape, and now he is gone.\u201d\u00a0Michal answered Saul, \u201cDavid told me he would kill me if I didn\u2019t help him escape.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-19-18": "David Goes to the Camps at Ramah\u00a018\u00a0David escaped and ran away to Samuel at Ramah. He told Samuel everything that Saul had done to him. Then David and Samuel went to the camps where the prophets stayed. David stayed there.",
  "1Samuel-19-19": "19\u00a0Saul heard that David was there in the camps near Ramah.",
  "1Samuel-19-20": "20\u00a0So he sent some men to arrest David. But when they came to the camps, there was a group of prophets prophesying.[a] Samuel was standing there leading the group. The Spirit of God came on Saul\u2019s messengers and they began prophesying.",
  "1Samuel-19-21": "21\u00a0Saul heard about this, so he sent other messengers, but they also began prophesying. So Saul sent messengers a third time, and they also began prophesying.",
  "1Samuel-19-22": "22\u00a0Finally, Saul himself went to Ramah. Saul came to the big well by the threshing floor at Secu. He asked, \u201cWhere are Samuel and David?\u201d\u00a0The people answered, \u201cIn the camps near Ramah.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-19-23": "23\u00a0So Saul went out to the camps near Ramah. The Spirit of God came on Saul, and he also began prophesying. He prophesied all the way to the camps at Ramah.",
  "1Samuel-19-24": "24\u00a0Saul even took off his clothes. He lay there naked all day and through the night. So even Saul prophesied there in front of Samuel.\u00a0That is why people say, \u201cIs Saul also one of the prophets?\u201d",
  "1Samuel-20-1": "David and Jonathan Make an Agreement\u00a020\u00a0David ran away from the camps at Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked him, \u201cWhat have I done wrong? What is my crime? Why is your father trying to kill me?\u201d",
  "1Samuel-20-2": "2\u00a0Jonathan answered, \u201cThat can\u2019t be true! My father isn\u2019t trying to kill you. My father doesn\u2019t do anything without first telling me. It doesn\u2019t matter how important it is, my father always tells me. Why would my father refuse to tell me that he wants to kill you? No, it is not true!\u201d",
  "1Samuel-20-3": "3\u00a0But David answered, \u201cYour father knows very well that I am your friend. Your father said to himself, \u2018Jonathan must not know about it. If he knows, he will tell David.\u2019[a] But as surely as you and the Lord are alive, I am very close to death.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-20-4": "4\u00a0Jonathan said to David, \u201cI will do anything you want me to do.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-20-5": "5\u00a0Then David said, \u201cLook, tomorrow is the New Moon celebration. I am supposed to eat with the king, but let me hide in the field until the evening.",
  "1Samuel-20-6": "6\u00a0If your father notices I am gone, tell him, \u2018David wanted to go home to Bethlehem. His family is having its own feast for this monthly sacrifice. David asked me to let him run down to Bethlehem and join his family.\u2019",
  "1Samuel-20-7": "7\u00a0If your father says, \u2018Fine,\u2019 then I am safe. But if your father becomes angry, you will know that he wants to hurt me.",
  "1Samuel-20-8": "8\u00a0Jonathan, be kind to me. I am your servant. You have made an agreement with me before the Lord. If I am guilty, you may kill me yourself, but don\u2019t take me to your father.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-20-9": "9\u00a0Jonathan answered, \u201cNo, never! If I learn that my father plans to hurt you, I will warn you.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-20-10": "10\u00a0David said, \u201cWho will warn me if your father says bad things to you?\u201d",
  "1Samuel-20-11": "11\u00a0Then Jonathan said, \u201cCome, let\u2019s go out into the field.\u201d So Jonathan and David went together into the field.",
  "1Samuel-20-12": "12\u00a0Jonathan said to David, \u201cI make this promise before the Lord, the God of Israel. I promise that I will learn how my father feels about you. I will learn if he feels good about you or not. Then, in three days, I will send a message to you in the field.",
  "1Samuel-20-13": "13\u00a0If my father wants to hurt you, I will let you know. I will let you leave in safety. May the Lord punish me if I don\u2019t do this. May the Lord be with you as he has been with my father.",
  "1Samuel-20-14-1Sam-20-15": "14-15\u00a0As long as I live, show me the same kindness the Lord does. And if I die, never stop showing this kindness to my family. Be faithful to us, even when the Lord destroys all your enemies[b] from the earth.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-20-16": "16\u00a0So Jonathan made this agreement with David and his family, and he asked the Lord to hold them responsible for keeping it.[c]",
  "1Samuel-20-17": "17\u00a0Jonathan loved David as himself, and because of this love, he asked David to repeat this agreement for himself.",
  "1Samuel-20-18": "18\u00a0Jonathan said to David, \u201cTomorrow is the New Moon celebration. Your seat will be empty, so my father will see that you are gone.",
  "1Samuel-20-19": "19\u00a0On the third day go to the same place you hid when this trouble began. Wait by that hill.",
  "1Samuel-20-20": "20\u00a0On the third day I will go to that hill and shoot three arrows as if I am shooting at a target.",
  "1Samuel-20-21": "21\u00a0Then I will tell the boy to go find the arrows. If everything is fine, I will tell the boy, \u2018You went too far! The arrows are closer to me. Come back and get them.\u2019 If I say that, you can come out of hiding. I promise, as surely as the Lord lives, you are safe. There is no danger.",
  "1Samuel-20-22": "22\u00a0But if there is trouble, I will say to the boy, \u2018The arrows are farther away. Go get them.\u2019 If I say that, you must leave. The Lord is sending you away.",
  "1Samuel-20-23": "23\u00a0Remember this agreement between you and me. The Lord is our witness forever.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-20-24": "24\u00a0Then David hid in the field.\u00a0Saul\u2019s Attitude at the Celebration\u00a0The time for the New Moon celebration came, and the king sat down to eat.",
  "1Samuel-20-25": "25\u00a0He sat next to the wall where he usually sat, and Jonathan sat across from him. Abner sat next to Saul, but David\u2019s place was empty.",
  "1Samuel-20-26": "26\u00a0That day Saul said nothing. He thought, \u201cMaybe something happened to David so that he is not clean.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-20-27": "27\u00a0On the next day, the second day of the month, David\u2019s place was empty again. Then Saul said to his son Jonathan, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Jesse\u2019s son come to the New Moon celebration yesterday or today?\u201d",
  "1Samuel-20-28": "28\u00a0Jonathan answered, \u201cDavid asked me to let him go to Bethlehem.",
  "1Samuel-20-29": "29\u00a0He said, \u2018Let me go. Our family is having a sacrifice in Bethlehem. My brother ordered me to be there. Now if I am your friend, please let me go and see my brothers.\u2019 That is why David has not come to the king\u2019s table.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-20-30": "30\u00a0Saul was very angry with Jonathan and said to him, \u201cYou son of a twisted, rebellious woman! I know that you have chosen to support that son of Jesse.[d] This will bring shame to you and to your mother.",
  "1Samuel-20-31": "31\u00a0As long as Jesse\u2019s son lives, you will never be king and have a kingdom. Now, bring David to me! He is a dead man.\u201d",

  "1Samuel-20-33": "33\u00a0But Saul threw his spear at Jonathan and tried to kill him. So Jonathan knew that his father wanted very much to kill David.",
  "1Samuel-20-34": "34\u00a0Jonathan became angry and left the table. He was so upset and angry with his father that he refused to eat any food on the second day of the festival. He was angry because Saul humiliated him and because Saul wanted to kill David.",
  "1Samuel-20-35": "David and Jonathan Say Goodbye\u00a035\u00a0The next morning Jonathan went out to the field to meet David as they had agreed. Jonathan brought a little boy with him.",

  "1Samuel-20-40": "40\u00a0Jonathan gave his bow and arrows to the boy and told him to go back to town.",
  "1Samuel-20-41": "41\u00a0When the boy left, David came out from his hiding place on the other side of the hill. David gave a formal greeting by bowing to the ground three times to show his respect for Jonathan. But then David and Jonathan kissed each other and cried together. It was a very sad goodbye, especially for David.",
  "1Samuel-20-42": "42\u00a0Then Jonathan said to David, \u201cGo in peace. We have taken an oath in the Lord\u2019s name to be friends forever. We have asked the Lord to be a witness between us and our descendants forever.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-21-1": "David Goes to See Ahimelech the Priest\u00a021\u00a0Then David left and Jonathan went back to the town.

  "1Samuel-21-12": "12\u00a0David paid close attention to what they said. He was afraid of King Achish of Gath,",
  "1Samuel-21-13": "13\u00a0so he pretended to be crazy in front of Achish and his officers. While David was with them, he acted like a crazy man. He spat on the doors of the gate. He let spit fall down his beard.",

  "1Samuel-22-1": "David Goes to Different Places\u00a022\u00a0David left Gath and ran away to the cave[a] of Adullam. David\u2019s brothers and relatives heard that David was at Adullam and went to see him there.",
  "1Samuel-22-2": "2\u00a0Many people joined David. There were men who were in some kind of trouble, men who owed a lot of money, and men who were just not satisfied with life. All kinds of people joined David, and he became their leader. He had about 400 men with him.",
  "1Samuel-22-3": "3\u00a0David left Adullam and went to Mizpah in Moab. David said to the king of Moab, \u201cPlease let my father and mother come and stay with you until I learn what God is going to do to me.\u201d",

  "1Samuel-22-14": "14\u00a0Ahimelech answered, \u201cDavid is very faithful to you. Not one of your other officers is as faithful as David. He is your own son-in-law and the captain of your bodyguards. Your own family respects David.",
  "1Samuel-22-15": "15\u00a0That was not the first time I prayed to God for David. Not at all! Don\u2019t blame me or any of my relatives. We are your servants. I know nothing about what is happening.\u201d",

  "1Samuel-23-13": "13\u00a0So David and his men left Keilah. There were about 600 men who went with David. They kept moving from place to place. Saul learned that David had escaped from Keilah, so he did not go to that city.",
  "1Samuel-23-14": "Saul Chases David\u00a014\u00a0David went into the desert of Ziph and stayed in the mountains and fortresses there. Saul looked for David the whole time, but the Lord[b] didn\u2019t let Saul catch him.",

  "1Samuel-23-22": "22\u00a0Go and learn more about David. Keep track of where he goes and who goes to see him. I am told that David is smart and that he is trying to trick me.",
  "1Samuel-23-23": "23\u00a0Find all the hiding places that David uses. Then come back to me and tell me everything. Then I\u2019ll go with you. If David is in the area, I will find him, even if I must go to every family group in Judah.\u201d",

  "1Samuel-23-25": "25\u00a0Saul and his men went to look for David, but the people warned him. They told David that Saul was looking for him. So David then went down to \u201cThe Rock\u201d in the desert of Maon. Saul heard that David had gone there, so Saul went to that place to find him.",
  "1Samuel-23-26": "26\u00a0Saul was on one side of the mountain. David and his men were on the other side of the same mountain. David was moving as quickly as possible to get away from Saul. But Saul and his soldiers were going around the mountain to cut them off and trap David and his men.",
  "1Samuel-23-27": "27\u00a0Then a messenger arrived and told Saul, \u201cCome quickly! The Philistines are attacking.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-23-28": "28\u00a0So Saul stopped chasing David and went to fight the Philistines. That is why people call this place \u201cSlippery Rock.\u201d[c]",
  "1Samuel-23-29": "29\u00a0David left the desert of Maon and went to the fortresses near En Gedi.",
  "1Samuel-24-1": "David Shames Saul\u00a024\u00a0After Saul had chased the Philistines away, people told him, \u201cDavid is in the desert area near En Gedi.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-24-2": "2\u00a0So Saul chose 3000 men from all over Israel and began searching for David and his men. They looked near Wild Goat Rocks.",
  "1Samuel-24-3": "3\u00a0Saul came to some sheep pens beside the road. There was a cave near there, so Saul went in to relieve himself. David and his men were deep inside that same cave.",
  "1Samuel-24-4": "4\u00a0David\u2019s men told him, \u201cThis is day the Lord told you about when he said, \u2018I will give your enemy to you, and you can do whatever you want to him.\u2019\u201d\u00a0So David crawled closer and closer to Saul and cut off a corner of Saul\u2019s robe.

  "1Samuel-24-5": "5\u00a0Later, David felt bad about what he did.",
  "1Samuel-24-6": "6\u00a0He said to his men, \u201cI pray the Lord never lets me do anything like that to my master again. I must not do anything against Saul, because he is the Lord\u2019s chosen king.[a]\u201d",
  "1Samuel-24-7": "7\u00a0David said these things to stop his men. He would not let his men hurt Saul.\u00a0Saul left the cave and went on his way.",
  "1Samuel-24-8": "8\u00a0Later, David came out of the cave and called out to Saul, \u201cMy lord the king!\u201d\u00a0Saul looked back. David bowed with his face to the ground to show his respect.",
  "1Samuel-24-9": "9\u00a0David said to Saul, \u201cWhy do you listen when people say, \u2018David plans to hurt you\u2019?",
  "1Samuel-24-10": "10\u00a0You can see that with your own eyes that is not true. The Lord put you within my grasp today in the cave, but I refused to kill you. I was merciful to you. I said, \u2018I won\u2019t hurt my master. Saul is the Lord\u2019s chosen king.\u2019",
  "1Samuel-24-11": "11\u00a0Look at this piece of cloth in my hand. I cut off the corner of your robe. I could have killed you, but I didn\u2019t. Now, I want you to understand this. I want you to know that I am not planning anything against you. I did nothing wrong to you, but you are hunting me and trying to kill me.",
  "1Samuel-24-12": "12\u00a0Let the Lord be the judge. I hope the Lord will punish you for the wrong you did to me, but I won\u2019t fight you myself.",
  "1Samuel-24-13": "13\u00a0There is an old saying:\u00a0\u2018Bad things come from bad people.\u2019\u00a0\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything bad, and I won\u2019t hurt you.",
  "1Samuel-24-14": "14\u00a0Who are you chasing? Did the king of Israel bring an army to chase a single flea or a dying dog?",
  "1Samuel-24-15": "15\u00a0Let the Lord be the judge. Let him decide between you and me. He will support me and show that I am right. He will save me from you.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-24-16": "16\u00a0When David finished speaking, Saul asked, \u201cIs that your voice, David my son?\u201d Then Saul lifted his voice and began to cry.",
  "1Samuel-24-17": "17\u00a0He said, \u201cYou are right, and I am wrong. You were good to me, even though I have been bad to you.",
  "1Samuel-24-18": "18\u00a0You yourself said it when you told me about the good things you did. The Lord put my life in your hands, but you did not kill me.",
  "1Samuel-24-19": "19\u00a0This shows that you are not my enemy. A man doesn\u2019t catch his enemy, and then just let him go. He doesn\u2019t do good things for his enemy. May the Lord reward you for being good to me today.",
  "1Samuel-24-20": "20\u00a0Now, I know that you will become the new king. You will rule the kingdom of Israel.",
  "1Samuel-24-21": "21\u00a0Now make a promise to me with an oath using the Lord\u2019s name. Promise that you will not kill my descendants, even after I die. Promise me that you will not erase my name from my father\u2019s family.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-24-22": "22\u00a0So David made a promise to Saul. He promised that he would not kill Saul\u2019s family. Then Saul went back home. David and his men went back up to the fort.",
  "1Samuel-25-1": "David and Nabal the Fool\u00a025\u00a0Samuel died. All the Israelites met together and mourned his death. They buried him at his home in Ramah.\u00a0Then David moved to the desert of Maon.[a]",

  "1Samuel-25-11": "11\u00a0I have bread and water, and I have the meat I killed for my servants who cut the wool from my sheep. But I won\u2019t give them to men I don\u2019t even know.\u201d",
  "1Samuel-25-12": "12\u00a0David\u2019s men went back and told him everything that Nabal had said.",
  "1Samuel-25-13": "13\u00a0David\u2019s response was, \u201cPut on your swords.\u201d So David and his men put on their swords. About 400 men went with David while 200 of them stayed with the supplies.",
  "1Samuel-25-14": "Abigail Prevents Trouble\u00a014\u00a0One of Nabal\u2019s servants spoke to Nabal\u2019s wife Abigail. The servant said, \u201cDavid sent messengers from the desert to meet our master, but Nabal was rude to them.",
