  "1John-3-7": "7\u00a0Dear children, don\u2019t let anyone lead you into the wrong way. Christ always did what was right. So to be good like Christ, you must do what is right.",
  "1John-3-8": "8\u00a0The devil has been sinning since the beginning. Anyone who continues to sin belongs to the devil. The Son of God came for this: to destroy the devil\u2019s work.",
  "1John-3-9": "9\u00a0Those who are God\u2019s children do not continue to sin, because the new life God gave them[a] stays in them. They cannot keep sinning, because they have become children of God.",
  "1John-3-10": "10\u00a0So we can see who God\u2019s children are and who the devil\u2019s children are. These are the ones who are not God\u2019s children: those who don\u2019t do what is right and those who do not love their brothers and sisters in God\u2019s family.",
  "1John-3-11": "We Must Love One Another\u00a011\u00a0This is the teaching you have heard from the beginning: We must love each other.",
  "1John-3-12": "12\u00a0Don\u2019t be like Cain. He belonged to the Evil One. Cain killed his brother. But why did he kill him? Because what Cain did was evil, and what his brother did was good.",

  "1John-3-14": "14\u00a0We know that we have left death and have come into life. We know this because we love each other as brothers and sisters. Anyone who does not love is still in death.",

  "1John-3-16": "16\u00a0This is how we know what real love is: Jesus gave his life for us. So we should give our lives for each other as brothers and sisters.",
  "1John-3-17": "17\u00a0Suppose a believer who is rich enough to have all the necessities of life sees a fellow believer who is poor and does not have even basic needs. What if the rich believer does not help the poor one? Then it is clear that God\u2019s love is not in that person\u2019s heart.",
  "1John-3-18": "18\u00a0My children, our love should not be only words and talk. No, our love must be real. We must show our love by the things we do.",
  "1John-3-19-1John-3-20": "19-20\u00a0That\u2019s how we know we belong to the way of truth. And when our hearts make us feel guilty, we can still have peace before God, because God is greater than our hearts. He knows everything.",

  "1John-3-23": "23\u00a0This is what God commands: that we believe in his Son Jesus Christ, and that we love each other as he commanded.",
  "1John-3-24": "24\u00a0All who obey God\u2019s commands live in God. And God lives in them. How do we know that God lives in us? We know because of the Spirit he gave us.",
  "1John-4-1": "John Warns Against False Teachers\u00a04\u00a0My dear friends, many false prophets are in the world now. So don\u2019t believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see if they are from God.",
  "1John-4-2": "2\u00a0This is how you can recognize God\u2019s Spirit. One spirit says, \u201cI believe that Jesus is the Messiah who came to earth and became a man.\u201d That Spirit is from God.",
  "1John-4-3": "3\u00a0Another spirit refuses to say this about Jesus. That spirit is not from God. This is the spirit of the enemy of Christ. You have heard that the enemy of Christ is coming, and now he is already in the world.",
  "1John-4-4": "4\u00a0My dear children, you belong to God, so you have already defeated these false prophets. That\u2019s because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.",
  "1John-4-5": "5\u00a0And they belong to the world, so what they say is from the world too. And the world listens to what they say.",
  "1John-4-6": "6\u00a0But we are from God. So the people who know God listen to us. But the people who are not from God don\u2019t listen to us. This is how we know the Spirit that is true and the spirit that is false.",
  "1John-4-7": "Love Comes From God\u00a07\u00a0Dear friends, we should love each other, because love comes from God. Everyone who loves has become God\u2019s child. And so everyone who loves knows God.",
  "1John-4-8": "8\u00a0Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love.",
  "1John-4-9": "9\u00a0This is how God showed his love to us: He sent his only Son into the world to give us life through him.",
  "1John-4-10": "10\u00a0True love is God\u2019s love for us, not our love for God. He sent his Son as the way to take away our sins.",

  "1John-4-12": "12\u00a0No one has ever seen God. But if we love each other, God lives in us. If we love each other, God\u2019s love has reached its goal\u2014it is made perfect in us.",

  "1John-4-15": "15\u00a0Anyone who says, \u201cI believe that Jesus is the Son of God,\u201d is a person who lives in God, and God lives in that person.",
  "1John-4-16": "16\u00a0So we know the love that God has for us, and we trust that love.\u00a0God is love. Everyone who lives in love lives in God, and God lives in them.",
  "1John-4-17": "17\u00a0If God\u2019s love is made perfect in us, we can be without fear on the day when God judges the world. We will be without fear, because in this world we are like Jesus.[a]",
  "1John-4-18": "18\u00a0Where God\u2019s love is, there is no fear, because God\u2019s perfect love takes away fear. It is his punishment that makes a person fear. So his love is not made perfect in the one who has fear.",
  "1John-4-19": "19\u00a0We love because God first loved us.",
  "1John-4-20": "20\u00a0If we say we love God but hate any of our brothers or sisters in his family, we are liars. If we don\u2019t love someone we have seen, how can we love God? We have never even seen him.",
  "1John-4-21": "21\u00a0God gave us this command: If we love God, we must also love each other as brothers and sisters.",
  "1John-5-1": "God\u2019s Children Win Against the World\u00a05\u00a0The people who believe that Jesus is the Messiah are God\u2019s children. Anyone who loves the Father also loves the Father\u2019s children.",
  "1John-5-2": "2\u00a0How do we know that we love God\u2019s children? We know because we love God and we obey his commands.",
  "1John-5-3": "3\u00a0Loving God means obeying his commands. And God\u2019s commands are not too hard for us,",
  "1John-5-4": "4\u00a0because everyone who is a child of God has the power to win against the world.",
  "1John-5-5": "5\u00a0It is our faith that has won the victory against the world. So who wins against the world? Only those who believe that Jesus is the Son of God.",
  "1John-5-6": "God Told Us About His Son\u00a06\u00a0Jesus Christ is the one who came. He came with water and with blood.[a] He did not come by water only. No, Jesus came by both water and blood. And the Spirit tells us that this is true. The Spirit is the truth.",
  "1John-5-7": "7\u00a0So there are three witnesses that tell us about Jesus:",
  "1John-5-8": "8\u00a0the Spirit, the water, and the blood. These three witnesses agree.",
  "1John-5-9": "9\u00a0We believe people when they say something is true. But what God says is more important. And this is what God told us: He told us the truth about his own Son.",
  "1John-5-10": "10\u00a0Whoever believes in the Son of God has the truth that God told us. But people who do not believe God make God a liar, because they do not believe what God told us about his Son.",

  "1John-5-14": "14\u00a0We can come to God with no doubts. This means that when we ask God for things (and those things agree with what God wants for us), God cares about what we say.",
  "1John-5-15": "15\u00a0He listens to us every time we ask him. So we know that he gives us whatever we ask from him.",
  "1John-5-16": "16\u00a0Suppose you see your fellow believer sinning (sin that does not lead to eternal death). You should pray for them. Then God will give them life. I am talking about people whose sin does not lead to eternal death. There is sin that leads to death. I don\u2019t mean that you should pray about that kind of sin.",
  "1John-5-17": "17\u00a0Doing wrong is always sin. But there is sin that does not lead to eternal death.",
  "1John-5-18": "18\u00a0We know that those who have been made God\u2019s children do not continue to sin. The Son of God keeps them safe.[b] The Evil One cannot hurt them.",
  "1John-5-19": "19\u00a0We know that we belong to God, but the Evil One controls the whole world.",
  "1John-5-20": "20\u00a0And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding. So now we can know the one who is true, and we live in that true God. We are in his Son, Jesus Christ. He is the true God, and he is eternal life.",
