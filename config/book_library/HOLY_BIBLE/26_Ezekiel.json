  "Ezekiel-1-1-Ezek-1-3": "Introduction\u00a01\u00a0I am the priest, Ezekiel son of Buzi. I was in exile by the Kebar Canal in Babylonia when the skies opened up, and I saw visions of God. This was on the fifth day of the fourth month of the thirtieth year.[a] (This was the fifth year of King Jehoiachin\u2019s exile. The word of the Lord came to Ezekiel. The power of the Lord came over him at that place.)",
  "Ezekiel-1-4": "The Chariot of the Lord\u2014God\u2019s Throne\u00a04\u00a0I was watching a big storm come in from the north. It was a big cloud with a strong wind, and there was fire flashing from it. Light was shining out all around it. It looked like hot metal[b] glowing in a fire.",
  "Ezekiel-1-5": "5\u00a0Inside the cloud, there were four living beings that looked like people.",
  "Ezekiel-1-6": "6\u00a0But each one of them had four faces and four wings.",
  "Ezekiel-1-7": "7\u00a0Their legs were straight. Their feet looked like calves\u2019 feet, and they sparkled like polished brass.",
  "Ezekiel-1-8": "8\u00a0Under their wings were human arms. There were four living beings. Each living being had four faces and four wings.",
  "Ezekiel-1-9": "9\u00a0The wings touched each other. The living beings did not turn when they moved. They went in the direction they were looking.",
  "Ezekiel-1-10": "10\u00a0Each living being had four faces. In the front they each had a man\u2019s face. There was a lion\u2019s face on the right side and a bull\u2019s face on the left side. There was an eagle\u2019s face on the back.",
  "Ezekiel-1-11": "11\u00a0Their wings were spread out over them. With two of the wings each living being reached out to touch the one near it, and with the other two wings it covered its body.",
  "Ezekiel-1-12": "12\u00a0Each living being went in the direction it was looking. They went wherever the spirit[c] caused them to go, but they did not turn when they moved.",
  "Ezekiel-1-13": "13\u00a0That is what the living beings looked like.\u00a0Inside the area between the living beings, there was something that looked like burning coals of fire. This fire was like small torches that kept moving around among the living beings. The fire glowed brightly and lightning flashed from it.",
  "Ezekiel-1-14": "14\u00a0The living beings ran back and forth\u2014as fast as lightning.[d]",
  "Ezekiel-1-15-Ezek-1-16": "15-16\u00a0I was looking at the living beings when I noticed four wheels that touched the ground. There was one wheel by each living being. All the wheels looked the same. The wheels looked as if they were made from a clear, yellow jewel. They looked like there was a wheel inside a wheel.",
  "Ezekiel-1-17": "17\u00a0They could turn to move in any direction. But the living beings did not turn when they moved.[e]",
  "Ezekiel-1-18": "18\u00a0The rims of the wheels were tall and frightening. There were eyes all over the rims of all four wheels.",
  "Ezekiel-1-19": "19\u00a0The wheels always moved with the living beings. If the living beings went up into the air, the wheels went with them.",
  "Ezekiel-1-20": "20\u00a0They went wherever the spirit wanted them to go, and the wheels went with them, because the power that moved the living being was in the wheels.",
  "Ezekiel-1-21": "21\u00a0So if the living beings moved, the wheels moved. If the living beings stopped, the wheels stopped. If the wheels went into the air, the living beings went with them, because the spirit was in the wheels.",
  "Ezekiel-1-22": "22\u00a0There was an amazing thing over the heads of the living beings. It was like a bowl[f] turned upside down, and the bowl was clear like crystal.",
  "Ezekiel-1-23": "23\u00a0Under this bowl, each living being had wings reaching out to the one next to it. Two wings spread out one way and two wings spread out the other way, covering its body.",
  "Ezekiel-1-24": "24\u00a0Then I heard the wings. Every time the living beings moved, their wings made a very loud noise like a lot of water rushing by. They were loud like the Lord All-Powerful. They were as loud as an army or a crowd of people. When the living beings stopped moving, they put their wings down by their side.",
  "Ezekiel-1-25": "25\u00a0The living beings stopped moving and lowered their wings. Then there was another loud sound that came from above the bowl over their heads.",
  "Ezekiel-1-26": "26\u00a0There was something that looked like a throne on top of the bowl. It was blue like sapphire. There was also something that looked like a man sitting on the throne.",
  "Ezekiel-1-27": "27\u00a0I looked at him from his waist up. He looked like hot metal with fire all around him. I looked at him from his waist down. It looked like fire with a glow that was shining all around him.",
  "Ezekiel-1-28": "28\u00a0The light shining around him was like a rainbow in a cloud. It was the Glory of the Lord. As soon as I saw that, I fell to the ground. I bowed with my face to the ground, and then I heard a voice speaking to me.",
  "Ezekiel-2-1": "The Lord Speaks to Ezekiel\u00a02\u00a0The voice said, \u201cSon of man,[a] stand up and I will speak with you.\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-2-2": "2\u00a0Then the Spirit came into me[b] and lifted me up on my feet, and I listened to the one who spoke to me.",
  "Ezekiel-2-3": "3\u00a0He said, \u201cSon of man, I am sending you to speak to the family of Israel. Those people and their ancestors turned against me many times. They have sinned against me many times\u2014and they are still sinning against me today.",
  "Ezekiel-2-4": "4\u00a0I am sending you to speak to them, but they are very stubborn. They are very hardheaded, but you must speak to them. You must say, \u2018This is what the Lord God says.\u2019",
  "Ezekiel-2-5": "5\u00a0They are people who refuse to obey, so they may not listen to you. But even if they don\u2019t stop sinning, at least they will know that there is a prophet living among them.",
  "Ezekiel-2-6": "6\u00a0\u201cSon of man, don\u2019t be afraid of the people or what they say. It is true: they will turn against you and try to hurt you. Their words will be sharp like thorns and will sting like scorpions. But don\u2019t be afraid of what they say. They are people who refuse to obey, but don\u2019t be afraid of them.",
  "Ezekiel-2-7": "7\u00a0You must tell them what I say, whether they listen or not. They are people who usually refuse to listen!",
  "Ezekiel-2-8": "8\u00a0\u201cSon of man, listen to what I am telling you. Don\u2019t turn against me like those people who refuse to obey. Now open your mouth to receive the words I will give you to speak.\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-2-9": "9\u00a0Then I saw an arm reach out toward me. It was holding a scroll with words written on it.",
  "Ezekiel-2-10": "10\u00a0It rolled the scroll open in front of me. Words were on the front and on the back of the scroll. There were all kinds of sad songs, sad stories, and warnings.",
  "Ezekiel-3-1": "3\u00a0God said to me, \u201cSon of man,[a] eat what you see. Eat this scroll, and then go tell these things to the family of Israel.\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-3-2": "2\u00a0So I opened my mouth and he put the scroll into my mouth.",
  "Ezekiel-3-3": "3\u00a0Then God said, \u201cSon of man, I am giving you this scroll. Swallow it! Let that scroll fill your body.\u201d\u00a0So I ate the scroll. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth.",
  "Ezekiel-3-4": "4\u00a0Then God said to me, \u201cSon of man, go to the family of Israel. Speak my words to them.",
  "Ezekiel-3-5": "5\u00a0I am not sending you to some foreigners you cannot understand. You don\u2019t have to learn another language. I am sending you to the family of Israel.",
  "Ezekiel-3-6": "6\u00a0I am not sending you to many different countries where people speak languages you cannot understand. If you went to those people and spoke to them, they would listen to you. But you will not have to learn those hard languages.",
  "Ezekiel-3-7": "7\u00a0No, I am sending you to the family of Israel. Only, these people have hard heads\u2014they are very stubborn! And the people of Israel will refuse to listen to you. They don\u2019t want to listen to me.",
  "Ezekiel-3-8": "8\u00a0But I will make you just as stubborn as they are, and your head just as hard.",
  "Ezekiel-3-9": "9\u00a0A diamond is harder than flint rock. In the same way you will be more stubborn than they are, and your head will be harder. Then you will not be afraid of them or those who always turn against me.\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-3-10": "10\u00a0Then God said to me, \u201cSon of man, listen to every word I say to you and remember them.",
  "Ezekiel-3-11": "11\u00a0Then go to all of your people in exile and tell them, \u2018This is what the Lord God says \u2026.\u2019 They will not listen, and they will not stop sinning, but you must still tell them my message.\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-3-12": "12\u00a0Then the Spirit[b] lifted me up, and I heard a voice behind me. It was very loud, like thunder. It said, \u201cBlessed is the Glory of the Lord!\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-3-13": "13\u00a0Then the wings of the living beings began moving. The wings made a very loud noise as they touched each other, and the wheels in front of them began making a noise as loud as thunder.",
  "Ezekiel-3-14": "14\u00a0The Spirit lifted me and took me away. I was very sad and upset in my spirit, but I felt the Lord\u2019s power in me.",
  "Ezekiel-3-15": "15\u00a0I went to the people of Israel who were forced to live in Tel Aviv[c] by the Kebar Canal. I sat there among them for seven days, shocked and silent.",
  "Ezekiel-3-16": "The Watchman of Israel\u00a016\u00a0After seven days, the word of the Lord came to me. He said,",
  "Ezekiel-3-17": "17\u00a0\u201cSon of man, I am making you a watchman for Israel. I will tell you about bad things that will happen to them, and you must warn Israel.",
  "Ezekiel-3-18": "18\u00a0If I say, \u2018These evil people will die!\u2019 Then you must warn them. You must tell them to change their lives and stop doing evil. If you don\u2019t warn them, they will die because they sinned. But I will also make you responsible for their death, because you did not go to them and save their lives.",
  "Ezekiel-3-19": "19\u00a0\u201cIf you warn them and tell them to change their lives and stop doing evil, but they refuse to listen, they will die because they sinned. But since you warned them, you will have saved your own life.",
  "Ezekiel-3-20": "20\u00a0\u201cIf good people stop being good and begin to do evil, and I send something that makes them stumble and sin, they will die because they sinned. But since you did not warn them and remind them of the good things they had done, I will make you responsible for their death.",
  "Ezekiel-3-21": "21\u00a0\u201cBut if you warn good people and tell them to stop sinning, and they listen to your warning and stop sinning, they will not die. In that way you will have saved your own life.\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-3-22": "22\u00a0The Lord\u2019s power came to me. He said to me, \u201cGet up and go to the valley.[d] I will speak to you in that place.\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-3-23": "23\u00a0So I got up and went out to the valley. The Glory of the Lord was there\u2014as I had seen it by the Kebar Canal. So I bowed with my face to the ground.",
  "Ezekiel-3-24": "24\u00a0But the Spirit came into me and lifted me up on my feet. He said to me, \u201cGo home and lock yourself in your house.",
  "Ezekiel-3-25": "25\u00a0Son of man, people will come with ropes and tie you up. They will not let you go out among the people.",
  "Ezekiel-3-26": "26\u00a0I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth\u2014you will not be able to talk. So they will not have anyone to teach them that they are doing wrong, because they are always turning against me.",
  "Ezekiel-3-27": "27\u00a0But I will talk to you, and then I will allow you to speak. But you must say to them, \u2018This is what the Lord God says.\u2019 If a person wants to listen, fine. If a person refuses to listen, fine. But those people always turn against me.",
  "Ezekiel-4-1": "Warnings About the Attack of Jerusalem\u00a04\u00a0\u201cSon of man,[a] take a brick and scratch a picture on it. Draw a picture of a city\u2014the city of Jerusalem.",
  "Ezekiel-4-2": "2\u00a0And then pretend you are an army surrounding the city. Build a dirt wall around the city to help you attack it. Build a dirt road leading up to the city wall. Bring battering rams[b] and set up army camps around the city.",
  "Ezekiel-4-3": "3\u00a0And then take an iron pan and put it between you and the city. It will be like an iron wall separating you and the city. In this way you will show that you are against it. You will surround the city and attack it. This is an example for the family of Israel to show that I will destroy Jerusalem.",
  "Ezekiel-4-4": "4\u00a0\u201cThen you must lie down on your left side. You must do this thing that shows that you are taking the sins of the people of Israel on yourself. You will carry the guilt for as many days as you lie on your left side.",
  "Ezekiel-4-5": "5\u00a0You must bear the guilt of Israel for 390 days.[c] In this way I am telling you how long Israel will be punished; one day equals one year.",
  "Ezekiel-4-6": "6\u00a0\u201cAfter that time, you will lie on your right side for 40 days. This time you will bear the guilt of Judah for 40 days. One day equals one year. I am telling you how long Judah must be punished.",
  "Ezekiel-4-7": "7\u00a0\u201cNow, roll up your sleeve and raise your arm over the brick. Act like you are attacking the city of Jerusalem. Do this to show that you are speaking as my messenger to the people.",
  "Ezekiel-4-8": "8\u00a0Now look, I am tying ropes on you. You will not be able to roll over from one side to the other until your attack against the city[d] is finished.",
  "Ezekiel-4-9": "9\u00a0\u201cYou must get some grain to make bread. Get some wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt. Mix all these things together in one bowl and grind them to make flour. You will use this flour to make bread. You will eat only this bread during the 390 days that you lie on your side.",
  "Ezekiel-4-10": "10\u00a0You will be allowed to use only 1 cup[e] of that flour each day to make bread. You will eat that bread from time to time throughout the day.",
  "Ezekiel-4-11": "11\u00a0You can drink only 3 cups[f] of water each day. You can drink it from time to time throughout the day.",
  "Ezekiel-4-12": "12\u00a0You must make your bread each day. You must get dry human dung and burn it. Then you must cook the bread over this burning dung. You must eat this bread in front of the people.\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-4-13": "13\u00a0Then the Lord said, \u201cThis will show that the family of Israel will eat unclean bread in foreign countries and that I am the one who forced them to leave Israel and go to those countries!\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-4-14": "14\u00a0Then I said, \u201cOh, but Lord God, I have never eaten any unclean food. I have never eaten meat from an animal that died from a disease or from an animal that was killed by a wild animal. I have never eaten unclean meat\u2014not from the time that I was a little baby until now. None of that bad meat ever entered my mouth.\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-4-15": "15\u00a0Then God said to me, \u201cVery well, I will let you use dry cow dung to cook your bread. You don\u2019t have to use dry human dung.\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-4-16": "16\u00a0Then God said to me, \u201cSon of man, I am destroying Jerusalem\u2019s supply of bread. People will have only a little bread to eat. They will be very worried about their food supply, and they will have only a little water to drink. Every time they take a drink, they will feel more afraid.",
  "Ezekiel-4-17": "17\u00a0That is because there will not be enough food and water for everyone. They will be terrified as they watch each other wasting away because of their sins.",
  "Ezekiel-5-1-Ezek-5-2": "People of Jerusalem Scattered\u00a05\u00a0\u201cSon of man,[a] after your famine[b] you must do this: Take a sharp sword and use it like a barber\u2019s razor. Shave off your hair and beard. Put the hair on a scale and weigh it. Separate it into three equal parts. Put a third of your hair on the brick that has the picture of the city on it. Burn that hair in that \u2018city.\u2019 Then use the sword and cut a third of your hair into small pieces all around the outside of the \u2018city.\u2019 Next, throw a third of your hair into the air and let the wind blow it away. This will show that I will pull out my sword and chase some of the people into faraway countries.",
  "Ezekiel-5-3": "3\u00a0But then you must get a few of those hairs and wrap them up in your robe.",
  "Ezekiel-5-4": "4\u00a0Take some of those hairs and throw them into the fire. This will show that a fire will start there and burn throughout the whole house of Israel.[c]\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-5-5": "5\u00a0Then the Lord God said to me, \u201cThe brick is a picture of Jerusalem. I put Jerusalem in the middle of other nations with countries all around her.",
  "Ezekiel-5-6": "6\u00a0The people rebelled against my commands. They were worse than any of the other nations! They broke more of my laws than any of the people in the countries around them. They refused to listen to my commands. They did not obey my laws.\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-5-7": "7\u00a0So the Lord God says, \u201cI will do this because you did not obey my laws and commands. You broke more of my laws than the people who lived around you, and you did what even they know is wrong!\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-5-8": "8\u00a0So the Lord God says, \u201cSo now, even I am against you! I will punish you while those other people watch.",
  "Ezekiel-5-9": "9\u00a0I will do things to you that I have never done before. And I will never do those terrible things again, because you did so many terrible things.",
  "Ezekiel-5-10": "10\u00a0People in Jerusalem will be so hungry that parents will eat their own children, and children will eat their own parents. I will punish you in many ways, and those who are left alive, I will scatter to the winds.\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-5-11": "11\u00a0The Lord God says, \u201cJerusalem, I promise by my life that I will punish you! I promise that I will punish you, because you did terrible things to my Holy Place. You did horrible things that made it dirty. I will punish you. I will not show any mercy or feel sorry for you.",
  "Ezekiel-5-12": "12\u00a0A third of your people will die inside the city from diseases and hunger. Another third will die in battle outside the city. And then I will pull out my sword and chase the last third of your people into faraway countries.",
  "Ezekiel-5-13": "13\u00a0Only then will I stop being angry with your people. I will know that they have been punished for the bad things they did to me. They will know that I am the Lord and that I spoke to them because of my strong love[d] for them!\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-5-14": "14\u00a0God said, \u201cJerusalem, I will destroy you\u2014you will be nothing but a pile of rocks. The people around you will make fun of you. Everyone who walks by will make fun of you.",
  "Ezekiel-5-15": "15\u00a0People around you will make fun of you, but you will also be a lesson for them. They will see that I was angry and punished you. I was very angry and I warned you. I, the Lord, told you what I would do.",
  "Ezekiel-5-16": "16\u00a0I told you I would send you terrible times of hunger. I told you I would send you things that would destroy you. I told you that I would take away your supply of food and that those times of hunger would come again and again.",
  "Ezekiel-5-17": "17\u00a0I told you I would send hunger and wild animals against you that would kill your children. I told you there would be disease and death everywhere in the city. I told you I would bring enemy soldiers to fight against you. I, the Lord, told you all these things would happen!\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-6-1": "Prophecies Against Israel\u00a06\u00a0Then the word of the Lord came to me again.",
  "Ezekiel-6-2": "2\u00a0He said, \u201cSon of man,[a] turn toward the mountains of Israel and speak against them for me.",
  "Ezekiel-6-3": "3\u00a0Tell them this: \u2018Mountains of Israel, listen to this message from the Lord God! This is what the Lord God says to the hills and mountains and to the ravines and valleys: Look! I am bringing the enemy to fight against you. I will destroy your high places.",
  "Ezekiel-6-4": "4\u00a0Your altars will be broken into pieces. Your incense altars will be smashed, and I will throw down your dead bodies in front of your filthy idols.",
  "Ezekiel-6-5": "5\u00a0I will put the dead bodies of the people of Israel in front of their filthy idols. I will scatter your bones around your altars.",
  "Ezekiel-6-6": "6\u00a0Bad things will happen wherever your people live. Their cities will become piles of rock. Their high places will be destroyed so that those places of worship will never be used again. The altars will all be destroyed. People will never worship those filthy idols again. The incense altars will be smashed. Everything you made will be destroyed completely.",
  "Ezekiel-6-7": "7\u00a0Your people will be killed, and then you will know that I am the Lord!\u2019\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-6-8": "8\u00a0God said, \u201cBut I will let a few of your people escape. They will live in other countries for a short time. I will scatter them and force them to live in other countries.",
  "Ezekiel-6-9": "9\u00a0Then the survivors will be taken as prisoners. They will be forced to live in other countries, but they will remember me. I broke their spirit.[b] They will hate themselves for the evil things they did. In the past, they turned away from me and left me. They chased after their filthy idols. They were like a woman leaving her husband and running off with another man. They did many terrible things,",
  "Ezekiel-6-10": "10\u00a0but they will learn that I am the Lord. Then they will know that if I say that I will do something, I will do it! They will know that I caused all the troubles that happened to them.\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-6-11": "11\u00a0Then the Lord God said to me, \u201cClap your hands and stamp your feet. Speak against all the terrible things that the people of Israel have done. Warn them that they will be killed by disease and hunger. Tell them they will be killed in war.",
  "Ezekiel-6-12": "12\u00a0People far away will die from disease. People near this place will be killed with swords, and those who are left in the city will starve to death. Only then will I stop being angry.",
  "Ezekiel-6-13": "13\u00a0Only then will you know that I am the Lord. You will know this when you see your dead bodies in front of your filthy idols and around their altars. Those bodies will be near every one of your places for worship,[c] on every high hill and mountain, under every green tree and every oak tree with leaves. You offered your sacrifices everywhere. They were a sweet smell for your filthy idols.",
  "Ezekiel-6-14": "14\u00a0But I will raise my arm over you and punish you and your people, wherever they live! I will destroy your country! It will be completely empty from the desert in the south to Riblah[d] in the north. Then they will know that I am the Lord!\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-7-1": "Disaster Is Coming to Jerusalem\u00a07\u00a0Then the word of the Lord came to me.",
  "Ezekiel-7-2": "2\u00a0He said, \u201cNow, son of man, here is a message from the Lord God. This message is for the land of Israel:\u00a0\u201cThe end!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The end is coming.\u00a0The end is coming.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The whole country will be destroyed.\u00a0The whole country will be destroyed.",

  "Ezekiel-7-7": "7\u00a0You people living in Israel, disaster is coming. It is time for punishment. Those are not shouts of joy in the mountains. Those are cries of panic.",
  "Ezekiel-7-8": "8\u00a0Very soon now, I will show you how angry I am. I will show all of my anger against you. I will punish you for the evil things you did. I will make you pay for all the terrible things you did.",

  "Ezekiel-7-10": "10\u00a0\u201cThat time of punishment has come like a plant sprouting, budding, and flowering. God has given the signal, the enemy is prepared, and their proud king is ready.",
  "Ezekiel-7-11": "11\u00a0This violent man is ready to punish the evil people. There are many people in Israel\u2014but he is not one of them. He is not a person in that crowd. He is not some important leader from them.",
  "Ezekiel-7-12": "12\u00a0\u201cThe time of punishment has come. The day is here. Those who buy things will not be happy, and those who sell things will not feel bad about selling them because that terrible punishment will happen to everyone.",
  "Ezekiel-7-13": "13\u00a0The people who sold their property[a] will never go back to it. Even if some people escape alive, they will never go back to their property, because this vision is for the whole crowd. So even if some people escape alive, it will not make everyone feel better.",
  "Ezekiel-7-14": "14\u00a0\u201cThey will blow the trumpet to warn the people. The people will get ready for battle, but they will not go out to fight because I will show the whole crowd how angry I am.",
  "Ezekiel-7-15": "15\u00a0The enemy with his sword is outside the city. Disease and hunger is inside the city. If some people go out into the fields, enemy soldiers will kill them. If they stay in the city, hunger and disease will destroy them.",
  "Ezekiel-7-16": "16\u00a0\u201cBut some people will escape. The survivors will run to the mountains, but they will not be happy. They will be sad for all their sins. They will cry and make sad noises like doves.",
  "Ezekiel-7-17": "17\u00a0They will be too tired and sad to raise their arms. Their legs will be like water.",
  "Ezekiel-7-18": "18\u00a0They will wear sackcloth and be covered with fear. You will see the shame on every face. They will shave their heads to show their sadness.",
  "Ezekiel-7-19": "19\u00a0They will throw their silver idols into the streets. They will treat their gold statues like dirty rags, because those things will not be able to save them when the Lord shows his anger. Those things were nothing but a trap that caused the people to fall. They will not give food to the people or put food in their bellies.",
  "Ezekiel-7-20": "20\u00a0\u201cThey used their beautiful jewelry and made an idol. They were proud of that statue. They made their terrible statues. They made those filthy things, so I will throw them away like a dirty rag.",
  "Ezekiel-7-21": "21\u00a0I will let strangers take them. Those strangers will make fun of them. They will kill some of the people and take others away as prisoners.",
  "Ezekiel-7-22": "22\u00a0I will turn my head away from them\u2014I will not look at them. The strangers will ruin my Temple\u2014they will go into the secret parts of that holy building and make it unfit for worship.",

  "Ezekiel-7-26": "26\u00a0You will hear one sad story after another. You will hear nothing but bad news. You will look for a prophet and ask him for a vision. The priests will have nothing to teach you, and the elders will not have any good advice to give you.",
  "Ezekiel-7-27": "27\u00a0Your king will be crying for the people who died. The leaders will wear sackcloth. The common people will be very afraid, because I will pay them back for what they did.

  "Ezekiel-8-1": "Sinful Things Done at the Temple\u00a08\u00a0One day I, Ezekiel, was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting there in front of me. This was on the fifth day of the sixth month of the sixth year of exile.[a] Suddenly, the power of the Lord God came on me.",
  "Ezekiel-8-2": "2\u00a0I saw something that looked like fire, like a man\u2019s body. From the waist down, he was like fire. From the waist up, he was bright and shining like hot metal[b] in a fire.",
  "Ezekiel-8-3": "3\u00a0Then I saw something that looked like an arm. The arm reached out and grabbed me by the hair on my head. Then the Spirit[c] lifted me into the air, and in a vision from God he took me to Jerusalem. He took me to the inner gate\u2014the gate that is on the north side. The statue that makes God jealous is by that gate.",
  "Ezekiel-8-4": "4\u00a0But the Glory of the God of Israel was there. The Glory looked just like the vision I saw in the valley by the Kebar Canal.",
  "Ezekiel-8-5": "5\u00a0God spoke to me. He said, \u201cSon of man,[d] look toward the north.\u201d So I looked, and there, north of the Altar Gate by the entrance, was that statue that made God jealous.",
  "Ezekiel-8-6": "6\u00a0Then God said to me, \u201cSon of man, do you see what terrible things the people of Israel are doing? They built that thing here, right next to my Temple! And if you come with me, you will see even more terrible things!\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-8-7": "7\u00a0So I went to the entrance to the courtyard, and I saw a hole in the wall.",
  "Ezekiel-8-8": "8\u00a0God said to me, \u201cSon of man, make a hole in the wall.\u201d So I made a hole in the wall, and there I saw a door.",
  "Ezekiel-8-9": "9\u00a0Then God said to me, \u201cGo in and look at the terrible, evil things that the people are doing here.\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-8-10": "10\u00a0So I went in and looked. I saw statues of all kinds of reptiles[e] and animals that you hate to think about. The statues were the filthy idols that the people of Israel worshiped. There were pictures of those animals carved all around on every wall!",
  "Ezekiel-8-11": "11\u00a0Then I noticed that Jaazaniah son of Shaphan and the 70 elders of Israel were there with the people worshiping in that place. There they were, right at the front of the people, and each leader had his own incense dish in his hand. The smoke from the burning incense was rising into the air.",
  "Ezekiel-8-12": "12\u00a0Then God said to me, \u201cSon of man, do you see what the elders of Israel do in the dark? Each man has a special room for his own false god. They say to themselves, \u2018The Lord cannot see us. The Lord left this country.\u2019\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-8-13": "13\u00a0Then he said to me, \u201cIf you come with me, you will see these men doing even more terrible things!\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-8-14": "14\u00a0Then God led me to the entrance to the Lord\u2019s Temple. This gate was on the north side. I saw women sitting there and crying. They were sad about the false god Tammuz[f]!",
  "Ezekiel-8-15": "15\u00a0God said to me, \u201cSon of man, do you see these terrible things? Come with me and you will see things that are even worse than this!\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-8-16": "16\u00a0Then he led me to the inner courtyard of the Lord\u2019s Temple area. There I saw 25 men bowing down and worshiping. They were at the entrance to the Lord\u2019s Temple between the porch and the altar\u2014but they were facing the wrong way. Their backs were to the Holy Place. They were bowing down to worship the sun!",
  "Ezekiel-8-17": "17\u00a0Then God said, \u201cSon of man, do you see this? The people of Judah think my Temple is so unimportant that they will do these terrible things here in my Temple! This country is filled with violence, and they constantly do things to make me angry. Look, they are wearing rings in their noses to honor the moon as a false god![g]",
  "Ezekiel-8-18": "18\u00a0I will show them my anger! I will not show them any mercy or feel sorry for them! They will shout to me\u2014but I refuse to listen to them!\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-9-1": "God\u2019s Messengers Punish Jerusalem\u00a09\u00a0Then God shouted to the leaders in charge of punishing the city. Each leader had his own destructive weapon in his hand.[a]",
  "Ezekiel-9-2": "2\u00a0Then I saw six men walking on the road from the upper gate. This gate is on the north side. Each man had his own deadly weapon in his hand. One of the men wore linen clothes.[b] He wore a scribe\u2019s pen and ink set[c] at his waist. Those men went to the bronze altar in the Temple and stood there.",
  "Ezekiel-9-3": "3\u00a0Then the Glory of the God of Israel rose from above the Cherub angels where he had been. Then the Glory went to the door of the Temple and stopped when he was over the threshold. Then he called to the man wearing the linen clothes and the scribe\u2019s pen and ink set.",
  "Ezekiel-9-4": "4\u00a0Then the Lord said to him, \u201cGo through the city of Jerusalem. Put a mark on the forehead of everyone who feels sad and upset about all the terrible things people are doing in this city.\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-9-5-Ezek-9-6": "5-6\u00a0Then I heard God say to the other men, \u201cI want you to follow the first man. You must kill all those who do not have the mark on their foreheads. It doesn\u2019t matter if they are elders, young men or young women, children or mothers\u2014you must use your weapon and kill everyone who does not have the mark on their forehead. Don\u2019t show any mercy. Don\u2019t feel sorry for anyone. Start here at my Temple.\u201d So they started with the elders in front of the Temple.",
  "Ezekiel-9-7": "7\u00a0He said to them, \u201cMake this Temple unclean\u2014fill this courtyard with dead bodies! Now go!\u201d So they went and killed the people in the city.",
  "Ezekiel-9-8": "8\u00a0I stayed there while the men went to kill the people. I bowed with my face to the ground and said, \u201cOh, Lord God, in showing your anger against Jerusalem, are you killing all the survivors in Israel?\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-9-9": "9\u00a0He said, \u201cThe family of Israel and Judah has committed many terrible sins! People are being murdered everywhere in this country, and the city is filled with crime. That is because the people say to themselves, \u2018The Lord has left this country. The Lord cannot see what we are doing.\u2019",
  "Ezekiel-9-10": "10\u00a0So I will not show any mercy or feel sorry for them. They brought it on themselves. I am only giving them the punishment they deserve!\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-9-11": "11\u00a0Then the man wearing linen clothes and a scribe\u2019s pen and ink set spoke up. He said, \u201cI have done what you commanded.\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-10-1": "The Glory of the Lord Leaves the Temple\u00a010\u00a0Then I looked up at the bowl[a] over the heads of the Cherub angels. The bowl looked clear blue like sapphire, and there was something that looked like a throne over it.",
  "Ezekiel-10-2": "2\u00a0Then the one sitting on the throne said to the man dressed in linen clothes,[b] \u201cStep into the area between the wheels[c] under the Cherub angels. Take a handful of the burning coals from between the Cherub angels and go throw them over the city of Jerusalem.\u201d\u00a0The man walked past me.",
  "Ezekiel-10-3": "3\u00a0The Cherub angels were standing in the area south[d] of the Temple as the man walked to them. The cloud filled the inner courtyard.",
  "Ezekiel-10-4": "4\u00a0Then the Glory of the Lord rose up off the Cherub angels near the threshold of the door of the Temple. Then the cloud filled the Temple, and the bright light from the Glory of the Lord filled the whole courtyard.",
  "Ezekiel-10-5": "5\u00a0The noise from the wings of the Cherub angels could be heard all the way out into the outer courtyard. The sound was very loud\u2014like the thundering voice when God All-Powerful speaks.",
  "Ezekiel-10-6": "6\u00a0God had given the man dressed in linen clothes a command. He had told him to go into the area between the wheels among the Cherub angels and get some hot coals. So the man went there and stood by the wheel.",
  "Ezekiel-10-7": "7\u00a0One of the Cherub angels reached out his hand and took some of the hot coals from the area between the Cherub angels. He poured the coals into the man\u2019s hands, and the man left.",
  "Ezekiel-10-8": "8\u00a0(The Cherub angels had what looked like human arms under their wings.)",
  "Ezekiel-10-9": "9\u00a0Then I noticed that there were four wheels. There was one wheel by each Cherub angel, and the wheels looked like a clear yellow jewel.",
  "Ezekiel-10-10": "10\u00a0There were four wheels, and they all looked the same. They looked like there was a wheel in a wheel.",
  "Ezekiel-10-11": "11\u00a0They could go in any direction when they moved, but the Cherub angels did not turn around when they moved. They went in the direction that the head was looking. They did not turn around when they moved.",
  "Ezekiel-10-12": "12\u00a0There were eyes all over their bodies. There were eyes on their backs, on their arms, on their wings, and on their wheels\u2014on all four wheels!",
  "Ezekiel-10-13": "13\u00a0These wheels were what I heard called, \u201cthe area between the wheels.\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-10-14-Ezek-10-15": "14-15\u00a0Each Cherub angel had four faces. The first was the face of a Cherub,[e] the second was the face of a man, the third was a lion\u2019s face, and the fourth was an eagle\u2019s face. (These Cherub angels were the living beings I saw in the vision by the Kebar Canal.[f])\u00a0Then the Cherub angels rose into the air,",
  "Ezekiel-10-16": "16\u00a0and the wheels rose with them. When the Cherub angels raised their wings and flew into the air, not even the wheels turned around.",
  "Ezekiel-10-17": "17\u00a0If they flew into the air, the wheels went with them. If they stood still, so did the wheels, because the spirit[g] of the living being was in them.",
  "Ezekiel-10-18": "18\u00a0Then the Glory of the Lord rose from the threshold of the Temple, moved to the place over the Cherub angels, and stopped there.",
  "Ezekiel-10-19": "19\u00a0Then the Cherub angels raised their wings and flew into the air. I saw them leave. The wheels went with them. Then they stopped at the East Gate of the Lord\u2019s Temple. The Glory of the God of Israel was in the air above them.",
  "Ezekiel-10-20": "20\u00a0These were the living beings under the Glory of the God of Israel in the vision at the Kebar Canal, and now I realized that they were Cherub angels.",

  "Ezekiel-10-22": "22\u00a0The faces of the Cherub angels were the same as the four faces on the living beings in the vision by the Kebar Canal. They all looked straight ahead in the direction they were going.",

  "Ezekiel-11-2": "2\u00a0Then God spoke to me and said, \u201cSon of man,[b] these are the men who make evil plans for this city. They always tell the people to do evil things.",

  "Ezekiel-11-9": "9\u00a0He also said, \u201cI will take you out of this city and give you to strangers. I will punish you.",
  "Ezekiel-11-10": "10\u00a0You will die by the sword. I will punish you here in Israel, so you will know that I am the Lord.",
  "Ezekiel-11-11": "11\u00a0Yes, this place will be the cooking pot, and you will be the meat cooking in it. I will punish you here in Israel.",
  "Ezekiel-11-12": "12\u00a0Then you will know that I am the Lord. It was my law that you broke. You did not obey my commands. You decided to live like the nations around you.\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-11-13": "13\u00a0As soon as I finished speaking for God, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died! I fell to the ground. I bowed with my face touching the ground and said, \u201cOh, Lord God, you are going to completely destroy all the survivors of Israel!\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-11-14": "Prophecies Against Survivors in Jerusalem\u00a014\u00a0But then the word of the Lord came to me. He said,",

  "Ezekiel-11-17": "17\u00a0But you must tell those people that the Lord God will bring them back. I have scattered you among many nations, but I will gather you together and bring you back from those nations. I will give the land of Israel back to you.",
  "Ezekiel-11-18": "18\u00a0When my people come back, they will destroy all the terrible, filthy idols that are here now.",
  "Ezekiel-11-19": "19\u00a0I will bring them together and make them like one person. I will put a new spirit[d] in them. I will take away that heart of stone, and I will put a real heart in its place.",

  "Ezekiel-11-22": "22\u00a0Then the Cherub angels raised their wings and flew into the air. The wheels went with them. The Glory of the God of Israel was above them.",

  "Ezekiel-12-3": "3\u00a0So, son of man, pack some things as if you are leaving on a trip. Pretend that you are a prisoner being taken far away. Do this during the day so that everyone can see you.

  "Ezekiel-12-4": "4\u00a0\u201cDuring the day, take your bags outside so that the people can see you. Then in the evening, pretend you are going away. Act as if you are a prisoner going to a faraway country.",

  "Ezekiel-12-6": "6\u00a0At night, put your bag on your shoulder and leave. Cover your face so that you cannot see where you are going. You must do these things so that the people can see you, because I am using you as an example to the family of Israel.\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-12-7": "7\u00a0So I did as I was commanded. During the day, I took my bags and acted as if I were going to a faraway country. That evening, I used my hands and made a hole in the wall. During the night, I put my bag on my shoulder and left. I did this so that all the people could see me.",
  "Ezekiel-12-8": "8\u00a0The next morning, the word of the Lord came to me. He said,",
  "Ezekiel-12-9": "9\u00a0\u201cSon of man, did the people of Israel\u2014those people who always refuse to obey\u2014ask you what you were doing?",

  "Ezekiel-12-16": "16\u00a0\u201cBut I will let a few of the people live. They will not die from the disease, hunger, and war. I will let them live so that they can tell other people about the terrible things they did against me. Then they will know that I am the Lord.\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-12-17": "Shake With Fear\u00a017\u00a0Then the word of the Lord came to me. He said,",

You will be very worried while you eat your food. You will be terrified while you drink your water, because everything in your country will be destroyed! This will happen because the people living there are so violent.",
  "Ezekiel-12-20": "20\u00a0Many people live in your cities now, but those cities will be ruined. Your whole country will be destroyed! Then you will know that I am the Lord.\u2019\u201d",

  "Ezekiel-12-25": "25\u00a0That\u2019s because I am the Lord, and if I say something will happen, it will happen! I will not wait any longer. Those troubles are coming soon\u2014in your own lifetime. Hear me, you people who always refuse to obey! When I say something, I make it happen.\u201d This is what the Lord God said.",
  "Ezekiel-12-26": "26\u00a0Then the word of the Lord came to me. He said,",
  "Ezekiel-12-27": "27\u00a0\u201cSon of man, the people of Israel think that the visions I give you are for a time far in the future. They think you are talking about things that will happen many years from now.",
  "Ezekiel-12-28": "28\u00a0So you must tell them this: \u2018The Lord God says, I will not delay any longer. If I say something will happen, it will happen!\u2019\u201d This is what the Lord God said.",
  "Ezekiel-13-1": "Warnings Against False Prophets\u00a013\u00a0Then the word of the Lord came to me. He said,",
  "Ezekiel-13-2": "2\u00a0\u201cSon of man,[a] you must speak to the prophets of Israel for me. They are only saying what they want to say. You must speak to them. Tell them this: \u2018Listen to this message from the Lord!",
  "Ezekiel-13-3": "3\u00a0This is what the Lord God says. Bad things will happen to you foolish prophets. You are following your own spirits. You are not telling people what you really see in visions.",
  "Ezekiel-13-4": "4\u00a0\u201c\u2018Israel, your prophets are false prophets. They are like jackals hunting for food among the ruins of a city.",
  "Ezekiel-13-5": "5\u00a0You have not put soldiers near the broken walls of the city. You have not built walls to protect the family of Israel. So when the day comes for the Lord to punish you, you will lose the war!",
  "Ezekiel-13-6": "6\u00a0\u201c\u2018Your prophets say they have seen visions. They did their magic to see what will happen next. But everything they said would happen is a lie. They claim to speak for the Lord, but the Lord did not send them. And they still think that what they said is what will happen.",
  "Ezekiel-13-7": "7\u00a0\u201c\u2018If you prophets saw visions, they were not true. And all you got from your magic was lies! So how can you say that the Lord told you those things? I did not speak to you!\u2019\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-13-8": "8\u00a0So now, the Lord God really will speak. He says, \u201cYou told lies. You saw visions that were not true. So now I am against you!\u201d This is what the Lord God said.",
  "Ezekiel-13-9": "9\u00a0\u201cI will punish those prophets whose visions are false and who lie about the future. I will remove them from my people. Their names will not be in the list of the family of Israel. They will never again come to the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord God!",
  "Ezekiel-13-10": "10\u00a0\u201cAgain and again those false prophets lied to my people. They said there would be peace, but there is no peace. The people need to fix the walls and prepare for war. But they only slap a thin coat of plaster[b] over the broken walls.",
  "Ezekiel-13-11": "11\u00a0Tell them that I will send hail and a strong rain. The wind will blow hard, and a tornado will come. Then the wall will fall down.",
  "Ezekiel-13-12": "12\u00a0When the wall falls down, the people will ask the prophets, \u2018What happened to the plaster you put on the wall?\u2019\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-13-13": "13\u00a0The Lord God says, \u201cI am angry and I will send a storm against you. I am angry and I will send a strong rain. I am angry and I will make hail fall from the sky and completely destroy you!",
  "Ezekiel-13-14": "14\u00a0You put plaster on the wall, but I will destroy the whole wall. I will pull it to the ground. The wall will fall on you, and then you will know that I am the Lord.",
  "Ezekiel-13-15": "15\u00a0I will finish showing my anger against the wall and those who put plaster on it. Then I will say, \u2018There is no wall, and there are no workers to put plaster on it.\u2019",
  "Ezekiel-13-16": "16\u00a0\u201cAll these things will happen to the false prophets of Israel. They speak to the people of Jerusalem and say there will be peace, but there is no peace.\u201d This is what the Lord God said.",
  "Ezekiel-13-17": "17\u00a0God said, \u201cSon of man, look at the women prophets in Israel. They say the things they want to say, so you must speak against them for me. You must say this to them:",
  "Ezekiel-13-18": "18\u00a0\u2018This is what the Lord God says: Bad things will happen to you women. You sew cloth bracelets for people to wear on their arms. You make special scarves for people to wear on their heads. You say those things have magic powers to control people\u2019s lives. You trap the people only to keep yourselves alive!",
  "Ezekiel-13-19": "19\u00a0You make them think I am not important. You turn them against me for a few handfuls of barley and a few scraps of bread. You tell lies to my people. They love to listen to lies. You kill those who should live, and you let people live who should die.",
  "Ezekiel-13-20": "20\u00a0So this is what the Lord God says to you: You make those cloth bracelets to trap people, but I will set them free. I will tear those bracelets off your arms, and the people will be free from you. They will be like birds flying from a trap.",
  "Ezekiel-13-21": "21\u00a0And I will tear up those scarves and save my people from your power. They will escape from your trap, and you will know that I am the Lord.",
  "Ezekiel-13-22": "22\u00a0\u201c\u2018You prophets tell lies. Your lies hurt good people\u2014I did not want to hurt them! You support the wicked and encourage them. You don\u2019t tell them to change their lives. You don\u2019t try to save their lives!",
  "Ezekiel-13-23": "23\u00a0So you will not see any more useless visions or do any more magic. I will save my people from your power, and you will know that I am the Lord.\u2019\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-14-1": "Warnings Against Idol Worship\u00a014\u00a0Some of the elders of Israel came to me. They sat down to talk with me.",
  "Ezekiel-14-2": "2\u00a0The word of the Lord came to me. He said,",
  "Ezekiel-14-3": "3\u00a0\u201cSon of man,[a] these men came to talk to you. But they still have their filthy idols. They kept the things that made them sin. They still worship those statues, so why do they come to me for advice? Should I answer their questions?",
  "Ezekiel-14-4": "4\u00a0But I will give them an answer. You must tell them this: \u2018This is what the Lord God says: If any Israelites come to a prophet and ask me for advice, I myself will answer their questions. I, the Lord, will answer them even if they still have their filthy idols, even if they kept the things that made them sin, and even if they still worship those statues. I will speak to them in spite of all their filthy idols.",
  "Ezekiel-14-5": "5\u00a0This is because I want to touch their hearts. I want to show them that I love them, even though they left me for their filthy idols.\u2019",
  "Ezekiel-14-6": "6\u00a0\u201cSo tell the family of Israel, \u2018This is what the Lord God says: Come back to me and leave your filthy idols. Turn away from those terrible, false gods.",
  "Ezekiel-14-7": "7\u00a0If any Israelites or foreigners who live in Israel come to me for advice, I will give them an answer. I, the Lord, will answer them even if they still have their filthy idols, even if they kept the things that made them sin, and even if they worship those statues. This is the answer I will give them:",
  "Ezekiel-14-8": "8\u00a0I will turn against them and destroy them. They will be an example to others. People will laugh at them. I will remove them from my people. Then you will know that I am the Lord!",
  "Ezekiel-14-9": "9\u00a0And if a prophet is foolish enough to give his own answer, I, the Lord, will show him how foolish he is! I will use my power against him. I will destroy him and remove him from among my people, Israel.",
  "Ezekiel-14-10": "10\u00a0So both the one who came for advice and the prophet who gave an answer will get the same punishment.",
  "Ezekiel-14-11": "11\u00a0Why? So that those prophets will stop leading my people away from me, and my people will stop being filthy with sin. Then they will be my special people, and I will be their God.\u2019\u201d This is what the Lord God said.",
  "Ezekiel-14-12": "Jerusalem Will Be Punished\u00a012\u00a0Then the word of the Lord came to me. He said,",
  "Ezekiel-14-13": "13\u00a0\u201cSon of man, I will punish any nation that leaves me and sins against me. I will stop their food supply. I might cause a famine and remove the people and animals from that country.",
  "Ezekiel-14-14": "14\u00a0I would punish that country even if Noah, Daniel, and Job[b] lived there. They could save their own lives by their goodness, but they could not save the whole country.\u201d This is what the Lord God said.",
  "Ezekiel-14-15": "15\u00a0\u201cOr I might send wild animals through that country to kill all the people. Then no one would travel through that country because of the wild animals.",
  "Ezekiel-14-16": "16\u00a0If Noah, Daniel, and Job lived there, those three men could save their own lives. But I promise by my own life that they could not save the lives of other people\u2014not even their own sons and daughters! That evil country would be destroyed.\u201d This is what the Lord God said.",
  "Ezekiel-14-17": "17\u00a0\u201cOr I might send an enemy army to fight against that country. The soldiers would destroy that country\u2014I would remove all the people and animals from that country.",

  "Ezekiel-14-19": "19\u00a0\u201cOr I might send a disease against that country. I will pour my anger down on the people. I will remove all the people and animals from that country.",
  "Ezekiel-14-20": "20\u00a0If Noah, Daniel, and Job lived there, those three men could save their own lives because they are good men. But I promise by my own life that they could not save the lives of other people\u2014not even their own sons and daughters!\u201d This is what the Lord God said.",
  "Ezekiel-14-21": "21\u00a0Then the Lord God said, \u201cSo think how bad it will be for Jerusalem. I will send all four of those punishments against that city! I will send enemy soldiers, hunger, disease, and wild animals against that city. I will remove all the people and animals from that country.",
  "Ezekiel-14-22": "22\u00a0Some of the people will escape from that country. They will bring their sons and daughters and come to you for help. Then you will see how bad those people really are, and you will feel better about all the troubles that I am bringing to Jerusalem.",
  "Ezekiel-14-23": "23\u00a0You will see how they live and all the bad things they do. Then you will know that I had a good reason for punishing them.\u201d This is what the Lord God said.",
  "Ezekiel-15-1": "Jerusalem, the Vine, Will Be Burned\u00a015\u00a0Then the word of the Lord came to me. He said,",
  "Ezekiel-15-2": "2\u00a0\u201cSon of man,[a] are the pieces of wood from a grapevine[b] any better than the little branches cut from trees in the forest?",
  "Ezekiel-15-3": "3\u00a0Can you use that wood from a grapevine to make anything? Can you use that wood to make pegs to hang dishes on?",
  "Ezekiel-15-4": "4\u00a0People throw that wood into the fire. The ends burn, and the middle is scorched.",
  "Ezekiel-15-5": "5\u00a0If you cannot make anything from that wood before it is burned, you surely cannot make anything from that wood after it is burned!",
  "Ezekiel-15-6": "6\u00a0So people throw the pieces of wood from a grapevine into the fire. It is just like wood from any other tree in the forest. In the same way I will throw the people living in Jerusalem into the fire!\u201d This is what the Lord God said.",
  "Ezekiel-15-7": "7\u00a0\u201cI will punish those people. But some of them will be like the sticks that don\u2019t burn completely. They will be punished, but they will not be destroyed completely. You will see that I punished them, and you will know that I am the Lord!",
  "Ezekiel-15-8": "8\u00a0I will destroy that country because the people left me to worship false gods.\u201d This is what the Lord God said.",
  "Ezekiel-16-1": "God\u2019s Love for Jerusalem\u00a016\u00a0Then the word of the Lord came to me. He said,",
  "Ezekiel-16-2": "2\u00a0\u201cSon of man, tell the people of Jerusalem about the terrible things they have done.",
  "Ezekiel-16-3": "3\u00a0You must say, \u2018This is what the Lord God says to Jerusalem: Look at your history. You were born in Canaan. Your father was an Amorite. Your mother was a Hittite.",
  "Ezekiel-16-4": "4\u00a0Jerusalem, on the day you were born, there was no one to cut your navel cord. No one put salt on you and washed you to make you clean. No one wrapped you in cloth.",
  "Ezekiel-16-5": "5\u00a0No one felt sorry for you or took care of you. On the day you were born, your parents threw you out into the field, because no one wanted you.",
  "Ezekiel-16-6": "6\u00a0\u201c\u2018Then I passed by. I saw you lying there, kicking in the blood. You were covered with blood, but I said, \u201cPlease live!\u201d Yes, you were covered with blood, but I said, \u201cPlease live!\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-16-7": "7\u00a0I helped you grow like a plant in the field. You grew and grew. You became a young woman: your periods began, your breasts grew, and your hair began to grow. But you were still bare and naked.",
  "Ezekiel-16-8": "8\u00a0I looked you over. I saw you were ready for love, so I spread my clothes over you[a] and covered your nakedness. I promised to marry you. I made the agreement[b] with you, and you became mine.\u2019\u201d This is what the Lord God said.",
  "Ezekiel-16-9": "9\u00a0\u201c\u2018I washed you in water. I poured water over you to wash away the blood that was on you, and then I put oil on your skin.",
  "Ezekiel-16-10": "10\u00a0[c] I gave you a nice dress and soft leather sandals, a linen headband, and a silk scarf.",
  "Ezekiel-16-11": "11\u00a0I also gave you some jewelry. I put bracelets on your arms and a necklace around your neck.",
  "Ezekiel-16-12": "12\u00a0I gave you a nose ring, earrings, and a beautiful crown to wear.",
  "Ezekiel-16-13": "13\u00a0You were beautiful in your gold and silver jewelry, and your linen, silk, and embroidered material. You ate the best foods. You were very, very beautiful, and you became the queen!",
  "Ezekiel-16-14": "14\u00a0You became famous for your beauty, all because I made you so lovely!\u2019\u201d This is what the Lord God said.",
  "Ezekiel-16-15": "Jerusalem, the Unfaithful Bride\u00a015\u00a0\u201cBut you began to trust in your beauty. You used the good name you had and became unfaithful to me. You acted like a prostitute with every man who passed by. You gave yourself to them all!",
  "Ezekiel-16-16": "16\u00a0You took your beautiful clothes and used them to decorate your places for worship.[d] And you acted like a prostitute there. You gave yourself to every man who came by!",
  "Ezekiel-16-17": "17\u00a0Then you took your beautiful jewelry that I gave you, and you used the gold and silver to make statues of men, and you had sex with them too!",
  "Ezekiel-16-18": "18\u00a0Then you took the beautiful cloth and made clothes for those statues. You took the perfume and incense I gave you and put it in front of those idols.",
  "Ezekiel-16-19": "19\u00a0I gave you bread, honey, and oil, but you gave that food to your idols. You offered them as a sweet smell to please your false gods. You acted like a prostitute with those false gods!\u201d This is what the Lord God said.",
  "Ezekiel-16-20": "20\u00a0\u201cYou and I had children together, but you took our children. You killed them and gave them to those false gods! But that is only some of the evil things you did when you were unfaithful to me and went to those false gods.",
  "Ezekiel-16-21": "21\u00a0You slaughtered[e] my sons and then passed them through the fire to those false gods.",
  "Ezekiel-16-22": "22\u00a0You left me and did all those terrible things. You never remembered what happened when you were young. You did not remember that you were naked and kicking in blood when I found you.",
  "Ezekiel-16-23": "23\u00a0\u201cAfter all these evil things, \u2026 it will be very bad for you!\u201d The Lord God said all these things.",
  "Ezekiel-16-24": "24\u00a0\u201cAfter all those things, you made a mound for worshiping that false god. You built those places for worshiping false gods on every street corner.",
  "Ezekiel-16-25": "25\u00a0You built your mounds at the head of every road. Then you degraded your beauty. You used it to catch every man who walked by. You raised your skirt so that they could see your legs, and you acted like a prostitute with those men.",
  "Ezekiel-16-26": "26\u00a0Then you went to Egypt, your neighbor that is always ready for sex. With more and more sexual sin, you made me angry.",
  "Ezekiel-16-27": "27\u00a0So I punished you! I took away part of your land. I let your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, do what they wanted to you. Even they were shocked at the evil things you did.",
  "Ezekiel-16-28": "28\u00a0Then you went to have sex with Assyria. You could not get enough. You were never satisfied.",
  "Ezekiel-16-29": "29\u00a0So you turned to Canaan, and then to Babylonia, and still you were not satisfied.",
  "Ezekiel-16-30": "30\u00a0You are so weak. You let all those men cause you to sin. You acted just like a prostitute who wants to be the one in control.\u201d This is what the Lord God said.",
  "Ezekiel-16-31": "31\u00a0God said, \u201cBut you were not exactly like a prostitute. You built your mounds at the head of every road, and you built your places for worship at every street corner. You had sex with all those men, but you did not ask them to pay you the way a prostitute does.",
  "Ezekiel-16-32": "32\u00a0You are a woman guilty of adultery. You would rather have sex with strangers than with your own husband.",
  "Ezekiel-16-33": "33\u00a0Most prostitutes force men to pay them for sex, but you gave money to your many lovers. You paid all the men around to come in to have sex with you.",
  "Ezekiel-16-34": "34\u00a0You are just the opposite of most prostitutes who force men to pay them, because you pay the men to have sex with you.\u201d",
  "Ezekiel-16-35": "35\u00a0Prostitute, listen to the message from the Lord.",
  "Ezekiel-16-36": "36\u00a0This is what the Lord God says: \u201cYou have spent your money[f] and let your lovers and filthy gods see your naked body and have sex with you. You have killed your children and poured out their blood. This was your gift to those false gods.",
  "Ezekiel-16-37": "37\u00a0So I am bringing all of your lovers together. I will bring all the men you loved and all the men you hated. I will bring them all together and let them see you naked.[g] They will see you completely naked.",
  "Ezekiel-16-38": "38\u00a0Then I will punish you. I will punish you as a murderer and a woman who committed the sin of adultery. You will be punished as if by an angry and jealous husband.",
  "Ezekiel-16-39": "39\u00a0I will let those lovers have you. They will destroy your mounds. They will burn your places for worship. They will tear off your clothes and take your beautiful jewelry. They will leave you bare and naked as you were when I found you.",
  "Ezekiel-16-40": "40\u00a0They will bring a crowd of people and throw rocks at you to kill you. Then they will cut you into pieces with their swords.",
  "Ezekiel-16-41": "41\u00a0They will burn your house. They will punish you so that all the other women can see. I will stop you from living like a prostitute. I will stop you from paying money to your lovers.",
  "Ezekiel-16-42": "42\u00a0Then I will stop being angry and jealous. I will calm down. I will not be angry anymore.",
  "Ezekiel-16-43": "43\u00a0Why will all these things happen? Because you did not remember what happened when you were young. You did all those bad things and made me angry. So I had to punish you for doing them, but you planned even more terrible things.\u201d This is what the Lord God said.",
  "Ezekiel-16-44": "44\u00a0\u201cAll the people who talk about you will now have one more thing to say. They will say, \u2018Like mother, like daughter.\u2019",
  "Ezekiel-16-45": "45\u00a0You are your mother\u2019s daughter. You don\u2019t care about your husband or your children. You are like your sister. Both of you hated your husband and your children. You are like your parents. Your mother was a Hittite and your father was an Amorite.",
  "Ezekiel-16-46": "46\u00a0Your older sister was Samaria. She lived to the north of you with her daughters. Your younger sister was Sodom.[h] She lived to the south of you with her daughters.",
  "Ezekiel-16-47": "47\u00a0You did all the terrible things they did, but you also did much worse!",
  "Ezekiel-16-48": "48\u00a0I am the Lord God. As I live, I swear that your sister Sodom and her daughters never did as many bad things as you and your daughters.",
  "Ezekiel-16-49": "49\u00a0\u201cYour sister Sodom and her daughters were proud. They had too much to eat and too much time on their hands, and they did not help poor, helpless people.",
  "Ezekiel-16-50": "50\u00a0Sodom and her daughters became too proud and began to do terrible things in front of me. So I punished them!",
  "Ezekiel-16-51": "51\u00a0\u201cAnd Samaria did only half as many bad things as you did. You did many more terrible things than Samaria! You have done so many more terrible things than your sisters have done. Sodom and Samaria seem good compared to you.",
  "Ezekiel-16-52": "52\u00a0So you must bear your shame. You have made your sisters look good compared to you. You have done terrible things, so you should be ashamed.",
  "Ezekiel-16-53": "53\u00a0\u201cI destroyed Sodom and the towns around it, and I destroyed Samaria and the towns around it. And I will destroy you too, Jerusalem. But I will build those cities again, and I will rebuild you too.",
  "Ezekiel-16-54": "54\u00a0I will comfort you. Then you will remember the terrible things you did, and you will be ashamed.",
  "Ezekiel-16-55": "55\u00a0So you and your sisters will be rebuilt. Sodom and the towns around her, Samaria and the towns around her, and you and the towns around you will all be rebuilt.",
  "Ezekiel-16-56": "56\u00a0\u201cIn the past, you were proud and made fun of your sister Sodom. But you will not do that again.",
  "Ezekiel-16-57": "57\u00a0You did that before you were punished, before your neighbors started making fun of you. The daughters of Edom[i] and Philistia are making fun of you now.",
  "Ezekiel-16-58": "58\u00a0Now you must suffer for the terrible things you did.\u201d This is what the Lord said.",
  "Ezekiel-16-59": "God Remains Faithful\u00a059\u00a0This is what the Lord God said: \u201cI will treat you like you treated me! You broke your marriage promise. You did not respect our agreement.",
  "Ezekiel-16-60": "60\u00a0But I will remember the agreement we made when you were young. I made an agreement with you that will continue forever!",
  "Ezekiel-16-61": "61\u00a0I will bring your sisters to you, and I will make them your daughters. That was not in our agreement, but I will do that for you. Then you will remember the terrible things you did, and you will be ashamed.",
  "Ezekiel-16-62": "62\u00a0So I will make my agreement with you, and you will know that I am the Lord.",
  "Ezekiel-16-63": "63\u00a0You will remember me, and you will be so ashamed of the evil things you did that you will not be able to say anything. But I will make you pure, and you will never be ashamed again!\u201d This is what the Lord God said.",
  "Ezekiel-17-1": "The Eagle and the Vine\u00a017\u00a0Then the word of the Lord came to me. He said,",
