  "Haggai-1-1": "It Is Time to Build the Temple\u00a01\u00a0On the first day of the sixth month of the second year that Darius was king of Persia, Haggai received a message from the Lord. This message was for Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Joshua son of Jehozadak. Zerubbabel was the governor of Judah and Joshua was the high priest. This is the message:",
  "Haggai-1-2": "2\u00a0This is what the Lord All-Powerful said, \u201cThe people say it is not yet the right time to build the Lord\u2019s Temple.\u201d",
  "Haggai-1-3": "3\u00a0Again Haggai received a message from the Lord. Haggai spoke this message:",
  "Haggai-1-4": "4\u00a0\u201cYou people think the right time has come for you to live in nice houses. You live in houses with beautiful wooden paneling on the walls, but the Lord\u2019s house is still in ruins.",
  "Haggai-1-5": "5\u00a0Now the Lord All-Powerful says, \u2018Think about what is happening.",
  "Haggai-1-6": "6\u00a0You have planted many seeds, but you have gathered only a few crops. You have food to eat, but not enough to get full. You have something to drink, but not enough to get drunk. You have some clothes to wear, but not enough to keep warm. You earn a little money, but you don\u2019t know where it all goes. It\u2019s as though there is a hole in your pocket!\u2019[a]\u201d",
  "Haggai-1-7": "7\u00a0The Lord All-Powerful said, \u201cThink about what you are doing.",
  "Haggai-1-8": "8\u00a0Go up to the mountains, get the wood, and build the Temple. Then I will be pleased with the Temple, and I will be honored.\u201d This is what the Lord said.",
  "Haggai-1-9": "9\u00a0The Lord All-Powerful said, \u201cYou people look for a big harvest, but when you go to gather the crop, there is only a little grain. So you bring that grain home, and then I send a wind that blows it all away. Why is this happening? Because my house is still in ruins while each of you runs home to take care of your own house.",
  "Haggai-1-10": "10\u00a0That is why the sky holds back its dew and why the earth holds back its crops.",
  "Haggai-1-11": "11\u00a0\u201cI gave the command for the land and the mountains to be dry. The grain, the new wine, the olive oil, and everything the earth produces will be ruined.[b] All the people and all the animals will become weak.\u201d",
  "Haggai-1-12": "Work Begins on the New Temple\u00a012\u00a0The Lord God had sent Haggai to speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and to the high priest, Joshua son of Jehozadak. So these men and all the people listened to the voice of the Lord their God and to the words of Haggai the prophet. And the people showed their fear and respect for the Lord their God.",
  "Haggai-1-13": "13\u00a0Then Haggai, the Lord\u2019s messenger, delivered this message to the people: \u201cThe Lord says, \u2018I am with you!\u2019\u201d",
  "Haggai-1-14": "14\u00a0Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel was the governor of Judah. Joshua son of Jehozadak was the high priest. The Lord made them and the rest of the people excited about working on the Temple of their God, the Lord All-Powerful.",
  "Haggai-1-15": "15\u00a0So they began this work on the 24th day of the sixth month in the second year Darius was the king.",
  "Haggai-2-1": "The Lord Encourages the People\u00a02\u00a0On the 21st day of the seventh month, this message from the Lord came to Haggai:",
  "Haggai-2-2": "2\u00a0\u201cSpeak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, the governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to all the people. Say this:",
  "Haggai-2-3": "3\u00a0\u2018How many of you people look at this Temple and try to compare it to the beautiful Temple that was destroyed? What do you think? Does this Temple seem like nothing when you compare it with the first Temple?",
  "Haggai-2-4": "4\u00a0But the Lord says, \u201cZerubbabel, don\u2019t be discouraged!\u201d And the Lord says, \u201cJoshua son of Jehozadak, you are the high priest. Don\u2019t be discouraged! And all you people who live in the land, don\u2019t be discouraged! Continue this work, because I am with you.\u201d This is what the Lord All-Powerful said.",
  "Haggai-2-5": "5\u00a0\u201c\u2018I made an agreement with you when you left Egypt, and I have kept my promise. My Spirit is with you, so don\u2019t be afraid!\u2019",
  "Haggai-2-6": "6\u00a0This is what the Lord All-Powerful said, \u2018In just a little while, I will once again shake things up. I will shake heaven and earth, and I will shake the sea and the dry land.",
  "Haggai-2-7": "7\u00a0I will shake up the nations, and they will come to you with wealth from every nation. And then I will fill this Temple with glory.\u2019 That is what the Lord All-Powerful said!",
  "Haggai-2-8": "8\u00a0\u2018All their silver really belongs to me! And all the gold is mine!\u2019 This is what the Lord All-Powerful said.",
  "Haggai-2-9": "9\u00a0And the Lord All-Powerful said, \u2018This last Temple will be more beautiful than the first one, and I will bring peace to this place.\u2019 Remember, this is what the Lord All-Powerful said.\u201d",
  "Haggai-2-10": "Today Begins a Time of Blessing\u00a010\u00a0On the 24th day of the ninth month in the second year Darius was king of Persia, this message from the Lord came to Haggai the prophet:",
  "Haggai-2-11": "11\u00a0\u201cThe Lord All-Powerful commands you to ask the priests what the law says about these things:",
  "Haggai-2-12": "12\u00a0\u2018Suppose a man carries some meat in the fold of his clothes. This meat is part of a sacrifice, so it is holy. If his clothes touch some bread, cooked food, wine, oil, or some other food, will the thing the clothes touch become holy?\u2019\u201d\u00a0The priests answered, \u201cNo.\u201d",
  "Haggai-2-13": "13\u00a0Then Haggai said, \u201cWhoever touches a dead body will become unclean. Now if they touch anything else, will it also become unclean?\u201d\u00a0The priests answered, \u201cYes, it will become unclean.\u201d",
  "Haggai-2-14": "14\u00a0Then Haggai said, \u201cThis is what the Lord God said: \u2018This is also true for the people of this nation. They were not pure and holy before me. So anything they did with their hands and anything they offered at the altar became unclean.",
  "Haggai-2-15": "15\u00a0\u201c\u2018Think about what has happened to you. Think about how things were before you began working on the Lord\u2019s Temple.",
  "Haggai-2-16": "16\u00a0People wanted 20 measures of grain, but there were only 10 measures in the pile. People wanted to get 50 jars of wine from the wine vat, but there were only 20.",
  "Haggai-2-17": "17\u00a0That was because I punished you. I sent the diseases that killed your plants and the hail that destroyed the things you made with your hands. I did this, but still you did not come to me.\u2019 This is what the Lord said.",
  "Haggai-2-18": "18\u00a0\u201cThe Lord said, \u2018Today is the 24th day of the ninth month. You have finished laying the foundation of the Lord\u2019s Temple. So notice what happens from this day forward:",
  "Haggai-2-19": "19\u00a0Your seed for planting is still in the barn. And look at the vines, the fig trees, and the pomegranate and olive trees. They have not yet produced any fruit. But beginning today, I will bless you.\u2019\u201d",
  "Haggai-2-20": "20\u00a0Another message from the Lord came to Haggai on the 24th day of the month. This is the message:",
  "Haggai-2-21": "21\u00a0\u201cGo to Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah and tell him that I will shake heaven and earth.",
  "Haggai-2-22": "22\u00a0And I will overthrow many kings and kingdoms and destroy the power of the kingdoms of those other people. I will destroy their chariots and their riders. I will defeat their war horses and riders. These armies are friends now, but they will turn against each other and kill each other with swords.\u201d",
  "Haggai-2-23": "23\u00a0This is what the Lord All-Powerful says: \u201cZerubbabel son of Shealtiel, my servant, I have chosen you. I, the Lord, tell you that at that time I will use you like a signet ring to represent my authority!\u201d\u00a0This is what the Lord All-Powerful said."
