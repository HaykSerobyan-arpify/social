  "2Kings-2-16": "16\u00a0They said, \u201cLook, we have 50 good men. Please let them go and look for your master. Maybe the Lord\u2019s Spirit has taken Elijah up and dropped him on some mountain or in some valley.\u201d\u00a0But Elisha answered, \u201cNo, don\u2019t send men to look for Elijah!\u201d",
  "2Kings-2-17": "17\u00a0The group of prophets begged Elisha until he was embarrassed. Then Elisha said, \u201cSend the men to look for Elijah.\u201d\u00a0The group of prophets sent the 50 men to look for Elijah. They looked three days, but they could not find him.",
  "2Kings-2-18": "18\u00a0So the men went to Jericho where Elisha was staying and told him. Elisha said to them, \u201cI told you not to go.\u201d",
  "2Kings-2-19": "Elisha Makes the Water Good\u00a019\u00a0The men of the city said to Elisha, \u201cSir, you can see this city is in a nice place, but the water is bad. That is why the land cannot grow crops.\u201d",
  "2Kings-2-20": "20\u00a0Elisha said, \u201cBring me a new bowl and put salt in it.\u201d\u00a0They brought the bowl to Elisha.",

  "2Kings-2-24": "24\u00a0Elisha looked back and saw them. He asked the Lord to cause bad things to happen to them. Then two bears came out of the forest and attacked the boys. There were 42 boys ripped apart by the bears.",

  "2Kings-3-12": "12\u00a0Jehoshaphat said, \u201cThe Lord\u2019s word is with Elisha.\u201d\u00a0So the king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went down to see Elisha.",
  "2Kings-3-13": "13\u00a0Elisha said to the king of Israel, \u201cWhat do you want from me? Go to the prophets of your father and mother.\u201d\u00a0The king of Israel said to Elisha, \u201cNo, we have come to see you because the Lord called us three kings together to let the Moabites defeat us.\u201d",
  "2Kings-3-14": "14\u00a0Elisha said, \u201cI respect King Jehoshaphat of Judah, and I serve the Lord All-Powerful. As surely as he lives, I came here only because of Jehoshaphat. I tell you the truth, if he were not here, I would not pay any attention to you. I would ignore you completely.",

  "2Kings-3-23": "23\u00a0They said, \u201cLook at the blood! The kings must have fought against each other. They must have destroyed each other. Let\u2019s go take the valuable things from the dead bodies!\u201d",
  "2Kings-3-24": "24\u00a0The Moabites came to the Israelite camp, but the Israelites came out and attacked the Moabite army. The Moabites ran away from the Israelites. The Israelites followed them into Moab to fight them.",
  "2Kings-3-25": "25\u00a0The Israelites destroyed the cities. They threw their stones[c] at every good field in Moab. They stopped up all the springs of water and cut down all the good trees. The Israelites fought all the way to Kir Hareseth. The soldiers surrounded Kir Hareseth and attacked it too.",
  "2Kings-3-26": "26\u00a0The king of Moab saw that the battle was too strong for him, so he took 700 men with swords to break through to the king of Edom. But they were not able to do it.",
  "2Kings-3-27": "27\u00a0Then the king of Moab took his oldest son, who would become the next king after him. On the wall around the city, the king of Moab offered his son as a burnt offering. This upset the Israelites very much. So the Israelites left the king of Moab and went back to their own land.",
  "2Kings-4-1": "A Prophet\u2019s Widow Asks Elisha for Help\u00a04\u00a0A man from the group of prophets[a] had a wife.

Do you want us to speak to the king for you, or to the captain of the army?\u2019\u201d\u00a0She answered, \u201cI am fine living here among my own people.\u201d",
  "2Kings-4-14": "14\u00a0Elisha said to Gehazi, \u201cWhat can we do for her?\u201d\u00a0He answered, \u201cI know! She does not have a son, and her husband is old.\u201d",
  "2Kings-4-15": "15\u00a0Then Elisha said, \u201cCall her.\u201d\u00a0So Gehazi called the woman. She came and stood at his door.",
  "2Kings-4-16": "16\u00a0Elisha said, \u201cAbout this time next spring, you will be holding your own baby boy in your arms.\u201d\u00a0The woman said, \u201cNo, sir! Man of God, don\u2019t lie to me!\u201d",
  "2Kings-4-17": "The Woman in Shunem Has a Son\u00a017\u00a0But the woman did become pregnant and gave birth to a son that next spring, just as Elisha had said.",

  "2Kings-4-24": "24\u00a0Then she put a saddle on a donkey and said to her servant, \u201cLet\u2019s go, and hurry! Go slow only when I tell you.\u201d",
  "2Kings-4-25": "25\u00a0The woman went to Mount Carmel to get the man of God.\u00a0The man of God saw the Shunammite woman coming from far away and said to his servant Gehazi, \u201cLook, there\u2019s the Shunammite woman!",
  "2Kings-4-26": "26\u00a0Please run now to meet her! Say to her, \u2018Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is the child all right?\u2019\u201d\u00a0She answered, \u201cEverything is all right.\u201d[d]",

  "2Kings-4-28": "28\u00a0Then she said, \u201cSir, I never asked for a son. I told you, \u2018Don\u2019t trick me!\u2019\u201d",
  "2Kings-4-29": "29\u00a0Then Elisha said to Gehazi, \u201cGet ready to go. Take my walking stick and go! If you meet anyone along the way, don\u2019t even stop to say hello to him. If anyone says hello to you, don\u2019t answer. Put my walking stick on the child\u2019s face.\u201d",

  "2Kings-6-19": "19\u00a0Elisha said to the Aramean army, \u201cThis is not the right way. This is not the right city. Follow me. I will lead you to the man you are looking for.\u201d Then Elisha led them to Samaria.[b]",
  "2Kings-6-20": "20\u00a0When they arrived at Samaria, Elisha said, \u201cLord, open the eyes of these men so that they can see.\u201d\u00a0Then the Lord opened their eyes, and the Aramean army saw they were in the city of Samaria!",
