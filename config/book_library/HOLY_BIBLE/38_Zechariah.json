  "Zechariah-13-1": "13\u00a0But at that time a new spring of water will be opened for David\u2019s family and for the other people living in Jerusalem. That fountain will be to wash away their sins and to make the people pure.",
  "Zechariah-13-2": "No More False Prophets\u00a02\u00a0The Lord All-Powerful says, \u201cAt that time I will remove all the idols from the earth. People will not even remember their names, and I will remove the false prophets and unclean spirits from the earth.",
  "Zechariah-13-3": "3\u00a0Whoever continues to prophesy will be punished. Even their parents, their own mother and father, will say to them, \u2018You have spoken lies in the name of the Lord, so you must die!\u2019 Their own mother and father will stab them for prophesying.",
  "Zechariah-13-4": "4\u00a0At that time the prophets will be ashamed of their visions and prophecies. They will not wear the rough cloth that shows a person is a prophet. They will not wear those clothes to trick people with the lies they call prophecies.",
  "Zechariah-13-5": "5\u00a0They will say, \u2018I am not a prophet. I am a farmer. I have worked as a farmer since I was a little child.\u2019",
  "Zechariah-13-6": "6\u00a0But other people will say, \u2018Then what are these wounds in your hands?\u2019 He will say, \u2018I was beaten in the house of my friends.\u2019\u201d",
  "Zechariah-13-7": "7\u00a0The Lord All-Powerful says, \u201cSword, wake up and strike the shepherd, my friend! Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will run away. And I will punish those little ones.",
  "Zechariah-13-8": "8\u00a0Two-thirds of the people in the land will be struck down and die,\u201d says the Lord, \u201cbut one-third will survive.",
  "Zechariah-13-9": "9\u00a0Then I will test those survivors by giving them many troubles. The troubles will be like the fire a person uses to prove silver is pure. I will test them the way a person tests gold. Then they will call to me for help, and I will answer them. I will say, \u2018You are my people.\u2019 And they will say, \u2018The Lord is my God.\u2019\u201d",
  "Zechariah-14-1": "The Day of Judgment\u00a014\u00a0Look, the Lord has a special day of judgment coming, when the riches you have taken will be divided in your city.",
  "Zechariah-14-2": "2\u00a0I will bring all the nations together to fight against Jerusalem. They will capture the city and destroy the houses. The women will be raped, and half of the people will be taken away as prisoners. But the rest of the people will not be taken from the city.",
  "Zechariah-14-3": "3\u00a0Then the Lord will go to war with those nations. It will be a real battle.",
  "Zechariah-14-4": "4\u00a0At that time he will stand on the Mount of Olives, the hill east of Jerusalem. The Mount of Olives will split in half. Part of the mountain will move to the north, and part to the south. A deep valley will open up, from the east to the west.",
  "Zechariah-14-5": "5\u00a0You will try to run away as that mountain valley comes closer and closer to you. You will run away like the time you ran from the earthquake during the time of King Uzziah of Judah. But the Lord my God will come, and all his holy ones[a] will be with him.",
  "Zechariah-14-6-Zech-14-7": "6-7\u00a0That will be a very special day. There will not be any light, cold, or frost. Only the Lord knows how, but there will not be any day or night. Then, when darkness usually comes, there will still be light.",
  "Zechariah-14-8": "8\u00a0At that time water will flow continually from Jerusalem.[b] That stream will split and part of it will flow east, and part of it will flow west to the Mediterranean Sea. And it will flow all year long, in the summer as well as in the winter.",
  "Zechariah-14-9": "9\u00a0And the Lord will be the King of the whole world. At that time all people will worship him as the only Lord with only one name.",
  "Zechariah-14-10": "10\u00a0And the whole land from Geba in the north to Rimmon in the south past Jerusalem will become a flat plain. The city of Jerusalem will stay in the same place, but it will be built high above the land around it. It will reach from the Benjamin Gate to the First Gate (that is, the Corner Gate) and from the Tower of Hananel to the king\u2019s winepresses.",
  "Zechariah-14-11": "11\u00a0People will move to Jerusalem because it will be a safe place to live. It will never again be destroyed.",
  "Zechariah-14-12": "12\u00a0But the Lord will punish the nations that fought against Jerusalem. He will send a terrible disease against them. Their skin will begin to rot while the people are still alive. Their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.",
  "Zechariah-14-13-Zech-14-15": "13-15\u00a0That terrible disease will be in the enemy camp, and all their horses, mules, camels, and donkeys will catch that terrible disease.\u00a0At that time they will be afraid of the Lord. Each man will grab his neighbor\u2019s hand, and they will fight each other. Even Judah will fight against Jerusalem. This will happen even while armies from all the nations are surrounding the city. There will be much gold, silver, and clothing.",
  "Zechariah-14-16": "16\u00a0Some of the people who came to fight Jerusalem will survive. And every year they will come to worship the king, the Lord All-Powerful. They will come to celebrate the Festival of Shelters.",
  "Zechariah-14-17": "17\u00a0And if people from any of the families on earth don\u2019t go to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord All-Powerful, no rain will fall on their land.",
  "Zechariah-14-18": "18\u00a0If any of the families in Egypt don\u2019t come to celebrate the Festival of Shelters, they will get that terrible disease that the Lord caused the enemy nations to get.",
  "Zechariah-14-19": "19\u00a0That will be the punishment for Egypt, and for any other nation that does not come to celebrate the Festival of Shelters.",
  "Zechariah-14-20": "20\u00a0At that time even the harnesses on the horses will have the label, holy to the lord.[c] And all the pots used in the Lord\u2019s Temple will be just as important as the bowls used at the altar.",
  "Zechariah-14-21": "21\u00a0In fact, every dish in Jerusalem and Judah will have the label, holy to the lord all-powerful. All the people offering sacrifices will come, take those dishes, and cook their special meals in them.\u00a0At that time there will not be any merchants buying and selling things[d] in the Temple of the Lord All-Powerful."
