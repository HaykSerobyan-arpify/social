  "Titus-1-1": "1\u00a0Greetings from Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ. I was sent to help God\u2019s chosen people have faith and understand the truth that produces a life of devotion to God.",
  "Titus-1-2": "2\u00a0This faith and knowledge make us sure that we have eternal life. God promised that life to us before time began\u2014and God does not lie.",
  "Titus-1-3": "3\u00a0At the right time, God let the world know about that life. He did this through the telling of the Good News message, and he trusted me with that work. I told people that message because God our Savior commanded me to.",
  "Titus-1-4": "4\u00a0To Titus, a true son to me in the faith we share together.\u00a0Grace and peace to you from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.",
  "Titus-1-5": "Titus\u2019 Work in Crete\u00a05\u00a0I left you in Crete so that you could finish doing what still needed to be done. And I also left you there so that you could choose men to be elders in every town.",
  "Titus-1-6": "6\u00a0To be an elder, a man must not be guilty of living in a wrong way. He must be faithful to his wife,[a] and his children must be faithful to God.[b] They must not be known as children who are wild or don\u2019t obey.",
  "Titus-1-7": "7\u00a0An elder[c] has the job of taking care of God\u2019s work. So people should not be able to say that he lives in a wrong way. He must not be someone who is proud and selfish or who gets angry quickly. He must not drink too much, and he must not be someone who likes to fight. He must not be a man who will do almost anything for money.",
  "Titus-1-8": "8\u00a0An elder must be ready to help people by welcoming them into his home. He must love what is good. He must be wise. He must live right. He must be devoted to God and pleasing to him. And he must be able to control himself.",
  "Titus-1-9": "9\u00a0An elder must be faithful to the same true message we teach. Then he will be able to encourage others with teaching that is true and right. And he will be able to show those who are against this teaching that they are wrong.",
  "Titus-1-10": "10\u00a0This is important, because there are many people who refuse to obey\u2014people who talk about worthless things and mislead others. I am talking especially about those who say that men who are not Jews must be circumcised to please God.",
  "Titus-1-11": "11\u00a0These people must be stopped, because they are destroying whole families by teaching what they should not teach. They teach only to cheat people and make money.",
  "Titus-1-12": "12\u00a0Even one of their own prophets said, \u201cCretans are always liars. They are evil animals and lazy people who do nothing but eat.\u201d",
  "Titus-1-13": "13\u00a0The words that prophet said are true. So tell those people that they are wrong. You must be strict with them. Then they will become strong in the faith,",
  "Titus-1-14": "14\u00a0and they will stop paying attention to the stories told by those Jews. They will stop following the commands of those who have turned away from the truth.",
  "Titus-1-15": "15\u00a0To people who are pure, everything is pure. But to those who are full of sin and don\u2019t believe, nothing is pure. Really, their thinking has become evil and their consciences have been ruined.",
  "Titus-1-16": "16\u00a0They say they know God, but the evil things they do show that they don\u2019t accept him. They are disgusting. They refuse to obey God and are not capable of doing anything good.",
  "Titus-2-1": "Following the True Teaching\u00a02\u00a0You, however, must tell everyone how to live in a way that agrees with the true teaching.",
  "Titus-2-2": "2\u00a0Teach the older men to have self-control, to be serious, and to be wise. They must be strong in faith, in love, and in patience.",
  "Titus-2-3": "3\u00a0Also, teach the older women to live the way those who serve the Lord should live. They should not go around saying bad things about others or be in the habit of drinking too much. They should teach what is good.",
  "Titus-2-4": "4\u00a0By doing this they will teach the younger women to love their husbands and children.",
  "Titus-2-5": "5\u00a0They will teach them to be wise and pure, to take care of their homes, to be kind, and to be willing to serve their husbands. Then no one will be able to criticize the teaching God gave us.",
  "Titus-2-6": "6\u00a0In the same way, tell the young men to be wise.",
  "Titus-2-7": "7\u00a0You should be an example for them in every way by the good things you do. When you teach, be honest and serious.",
  "Titus-2-8": "8\u00a0And your teaching should be clearly right so that you cannot be criticized. Then anyone who is against you will be ashamed. There will not be anything bad they can say about us.",
  "Titus-2-9": "9\u00a0And tell this to those who are slaves: They should be willing to serve their masters at all times; they should try to please them, not argue with them;",
  "Titus-2-10": "10\u00a0they should not steal from them; and they should show their masters that they can be trusted. Then, in everything they do, they will show that the teaching of God our Savior is good.",
  "Titus-2-11": "11\u00a0That is the way we should live, because God\u2019s grace has come. That grace can save everyone.",
  "Titus-2-12": "12\u00a0It teaches us not to live against God and not to do the bad things the world wants to do. It teaches us to live on earth now in a wise and right way\u2014a way that shows true devotion to God.",
  "Titus-2-13": "13\u00a0We should live like that while we are waiting for the coming of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ. He is our great hope, and he will come with glory.",
  "Titus-2-14": "14\u00a0He gave himself for us. He died to free us from all evil. He died to make us pure\u2014people who belong only to him and who always want to do good.",
  "Titus-2-15": "15\u00a0These are the things you should tell people. Encourage them, and when they are wrong, correct them. You have full authority to do this, so don\u2019t let anyone think they can ignore you.",
  "Titus-3-1": "The Right Way to Live\u00a03\u00a0Remind your people that they should always be under the authority of rulers and government leaders. They should obey these leaders and be ready to do good.",
  "Titus-3-2": "2\u00a0Tell them not to speak evil of anyone but to live in peace with others. They should be gentle and polite to everyone.",
  "Titus-3-3": "3\u00a0In the past we were foolish too. We did not obey, we were wrong, and we were slaves to the many things our bodies wanted and enjoyed. We lived doing evil and being jealous. People hated us and we hated each other.",
  "Titus-3-4": "4\u00a0But then the kindness and love of God our Savior was made known.",
  "Titus-3-5": "5\u00a0He saved us because of his mercy, not because of any good things we did. He saved us through the washing that made us new people. He saved us by making us new through the Holy Spirit.",
  "Titus-3-6": "6\u00a0God poured out to us that Holy Spirit fully through Jesus Christ our Savior.",
  "Titus-3-7": "7\u00a0We were made right with God by his grace. God saved us so that we could be his children and look forward to receiving life that never ends.",
  "Titus-3-8": "8\u00a0This is a true statement.\u00a0And I want you to be sure that the people understand these things. Then those who believe in God will be careful to use their lives for doing good. These things are good and will help everyone.",
  "Titus-3-9": "9\u00a0Stay away from those who have foolish arguments, who talk about useless family histories, or who make trouble and fight about what the Law of Moses teaches. These things are useless and will not help anyone.",
  "Titus-3-10": "10\u00a0Give a warning to all those who cause arguments. If they continue to cause trouble after a second warning, then don\u2019t associate with them.",
  "Titus-3-11": "11\u00a0You know that people like that are evil and sinful. Their sins prove they are wrong.",
  "Titus-3-12": "Final Instructions and Greetings\u00a012\u00a0I will send Artemas and Tychicus to you. When I send them, try hard to come to me at Nicopolis. I have decided to stay there this winter.",
  "Titus-3-13": "13\u00a0Zenas the lawyer and Apollos will be traveling from there. Do all that you can to help them prepare for their trip. Be sure that they have everything they need.",
  "Titus-3-14": "14\u00a0Our people must learn to use their lives for doing good and helping anyone who has a need. Then they will not have empty lives.",
  "Titus-3-15": "15\u00a0All the people with me here send you their greetings. Give my greetings to those who love us in the faith.\u00a0Grace be with you all."
