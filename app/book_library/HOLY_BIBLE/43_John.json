  "John-21-4": "4\u00a0Early the next morning Jesus stood on the shore. But the followers did not know it was Jesus.",
  "John-21-5": "5\u00a0Then he said to them, \u201cFriends, have you caught any fish?\u201d\u00a0They answered, \u201cNo.\u201d",
  "John-21-6": "6\u00a0He said, \u201cThrow your net into the water on the right side of your boat. You will find some fish there.\u201d So they did this. They caught so many fish that they could not pull the net back into the boat.",
  "John-21-7": "7\u00a0The follower Jesus loved very much said to Peter, \u201cThat man is the Lord!\u201d When Peter heard him say it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat around himself. (He had taken his clothes off to work.) Then he jumped into the water.",
  "John-21-8": "8\u00a0The other followers went to shore in the boat. They pulled the net full of fish. They were not very far from shore, only about 100 yards.[b]",

  "John-21-11": "11\u00a0Simon Peter got into the boat and pulled the net to the shore. It was full of big fish\u2014153 of them! But even with that many fish, the net did not tear.",
  "John-21-12": "12\u00a0Jesus said to them, \u201cCome and eat.\u201d None of the followers would ask him, \u201cWho are you?\u201d They knew he was the Lord.",
  "John-21-13": "13\u00a0Jesus walked over to get the bread and gave it to them. He also gave them the fish.",
  "John-21-14": "14\u00a0This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his followers after he was raised from death.",
  "John-21-15": "Jesus Talks to Peter\u00a015\u00a0When they finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \u201cSimon, son of John, do you love me more than these other men love me?\u201d\u00a0Peter answered, \u201cYes, Lord, you know that I love you.\u201d\u00a0Then Jesus said to him, \u201cTake care of my lambs.[c]\u201d",
  "John-21-16": "16\u00a0Again Jesus said to him, \u201cSimon, son of John, do you love me?\u201d\u00a0Peter answered, \u201cYes, Lord, you know that I love you.\u201d\u00a0Then Jesus said, \u201cTake care of my sheep.\u201d",
  "John-21-17": "17\u00a0A third time Jesus said, \u201cSimon, son of John, do you love me?\u201d\u00a0Peter was sad because Jesus asked him three times, \u201cDo you love me?\u201d He said, \u201cLord, you know everything. You know that I love you!\u201d\u00a0Jesus said to him, \u201cTake care of my sheep.",
  "John-21-18": "18\u00a0The truth is, when you were young, you tied your own belt and went where you wanted. But when you are old, you will put out your hands, and someone else will tie your belt. They will lead you where you don\u2019t want to go.\u201d",
  "John-21-19": "19\u00a0(Jesus said this to show how Peter would die to give glory to God.) Then he said to Peter, \u201cFollow me!\u201d",
  "John-21-20": "20\u00a0Peter turned and saw the follower Jesus loved very much walking behind them. (This was the follower who had leaned against Jesus at the supper and said, \u201cLord, who is it that will hand you over?\u201d)",
  "John-21-21": "21\u00a0When Peter saw him behind them, he asked Jesus, \u201cLord, what about him?\u201d",
  "John-21-22": "22\u00a0Jesus answered, \u201cMaybe I want him to live until I come. That should not matter to you. You follow me!\u201d",
  "John-21-23": "23\u00a0So a story spread among the followers of Jesus. They were saying that this follower would not die. But Jesus did not say he would not die. He only said, \u201cMaybe I want him to live until I come. That should not matter to you.\u201d",
  "John-21-24": "24\u00a0That follower is the one who is telling these things. He is the one who has now written them all down. We know that what he says is true.",
  "John-21-25": "25\u00a0There are many other things that Jesus did. If every one of them were written down, I think the whole world would not be big enough for all the books that would be written."
