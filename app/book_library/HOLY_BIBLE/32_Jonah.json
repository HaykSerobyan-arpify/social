  "Jonah-1-1": "God Calls and Jonah Runs\u00a01\u00a0The Lord spoke to Jonah[a] son of Amittai:",
  "Jonah-1-2": "2\u00a0\u201cNineveh[b] is a big city. I have heard about the many evil things the people are doing there. So go there and tell them to stop doing such evil things.\u201d",
  "Jonah-1-3": "3\u00a0But Jonah tried to run away from the Lord. He went to Joppa[c] and found a boat that was going to the faraway city of Tarshish. Jonah paid money for the trip and went on the boat. He wanted to travel with the people on this boat to Tarshish and run away from the Lord.",
  "Jonah-1-4": "The Great Storm\u00a04\u00a0But the Lord brought a great storm on the sea. The wind made the sea very rough. The storm was very strong, and the boat was ready to break apart.",
  "Jonah-1-5": "5\u00a0The men wanted to make the boat lighter to stop it from sinking, so they began throwing the cargo[d] into the sea. The sailors were very afraid. Each man began praying to his god.\u00a0Jonah had gone down into the boat to lie down, and he went to sleep.",
  "Jonah-1-6": "6\u00a0The captain of the boat saw Jonah and said, \u201cWake up! Why are you sleeping? Pray to your god! Maybe your god will hear your prayer and save us!\u201d",
  "Jonah-1-7": "What Caused This Storm?\u00a07\u00a0Then the men said to each other, \u201cWe should throw lots to find out why this is happening to us.\u201d\u00a0So the men threw lots. The lots showed that the troubles came to them because of Jonah.",
  "Jonah-1-8": "8\u00a0Then the men said to Jonah, \u201cIt is your fault that this terrible thing is happening to us. Tell us, what have you done? What is your job? Where do you come from? What is your country? Who are your people?\u201d",
  "Jonah-1-9": "9\u00a0Jonah said to them, \u201cI am a Hebrew. I worship the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the land and the sea.\u201d",
  "Jonah-1-10": "10\u00a0Jonah told the men he was running away from the Lord. The men became very afraid when they learned this. They asked Jonah, \u201cWhat terrible thing did you do against your God?\u201d",
  "Jonah-1-11": "11\u00a0The wind and the waves of the sea were becoming stronger and stronger. So the men said to Jonah, \u201cWhat should we do to save ourselves? What should we do to you to make the sea calm?\u201d",
  "Jonah-1-12": "12\u00a0Jonah said to the men, \u201cI know I did wrong\u2014that is why the storm came on the sea. So throw me into the sea, and the sea will become calm.\u201d",
  "Jonah-1-13": "13\u00a0Instead, the men tried to row the ship back to the shore, but they couldn\u2019t do it. The wind and the waves of the sea were too strong\u2014and they were becoming stronger and stronger.",
  "Jonah-1-14": "Jonah\u2019s Punishment\u00a014\u00a0So the men cried to the Lord, \u201cLord, please don\u2019t say we are guilty of killing an innocent man. Please don\u2019t make us die for killing him. We know you are the Lord, and you will do whatever you want.\u201d",
  "Jonah-1-15": "15\u00a0So the men threw Jonah into the sea. The storm stopped, and the sea became calm.",
  "Jonah-1-16": "16\u00a0When the men saw this, they began to fear and respect the Lord. They offered a sacrifice and made special promises to the Lord.",
  "Jonah-1-17": "17\u00a0When Jonah fell into the sea, the Lord chose a very big fish to swallow Jonah. He was in the stomach of the fish for three days and three nights.",
  "Jonah-2-1": "Jonah\u2019s Prayer\u00a02\u00a0While Jonah was in the stomach of the fish, he prayed to the Lord his God. He said,",
  "Jonah-2-2": "2\u00a0\u201cI was in very bad trouble.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I called to the Lord for help,\u00a0I called to the Lord for help,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and he answered me.\u00a0and he answered me.\u00a0I was deep in the grave.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I cried to you,\u00a0I cried to you,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and you heard my voice.\u00a0and you heard my voice.",
  "Jonah-2-3": "3\u00a0\u201cYou threw me into the sea.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Your powerful waves splashed over me.\u00a0Your powerful waves splashed over me.\u00a0I went down, down into the deep sea.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The water was all around me.\u00a0The water was all around me.",
  "Jonah-2-4": "4\u00a0Then I thought, \u2018Now I must go where you cannot see me,\u2019\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0but I continued looking to your holy Temple for help.\u00a0but I continued looking to your holy Temple for help.",
  "Jonah-2-5": "5\u00a0\u201cThe seawater closed over me.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The water covered my mouth,\u00a0The water covered my mouth,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and I could not breathe.[a]\u00a0and I could not breathe.[a]\u00a0I went down, down into the deep sea.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seaweed wrapped around my head.\u00a0Seaweed wrapped around my head.",
  "Jonah-2-6": "6\u00a0I was at the bottom of the sea,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the place where the mountains begin.\u00a0the place where the mountains begin.\u00a0I thought I was locked in this prison forever,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0but the Lord my God took me out of my grave.\u00a0but the Lord my God took me out of my grave.\u00a0God, you gave me life again!",
  "Jonah-2-7": "7\u00a0\u201cMy soul gave up all hope,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0but then I remembered the Lord.\u00a0but then I remembered the Lord.\u00a0I prayed to you,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and you heard my prayers in your holy Temple.\u00a0and you heard my prayers in your holy Temple.",
  "Jonah-2-8": "8\u00a0\u201cSome people worship useless idols,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0but those statues never help them.[b]\u00a0but those statues never help them.[b]",
  "Jonah-2-9": "9\u00a0I will give sacrifices to you,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and I will praise and thank you.\u00a0and I will praise and thank you.\u00a0I will make special promises to you,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and I will do what I promise.\u201d\u00a0and I will do what I promise.\u201d\u00a0Salvation only comes from the Lord!",
  "Jonah-2-10": "10\u00a0Then the Lord spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out of its stomach onto the dry land.",
  "Jonah-3-1": "God Calls and Jonah Obeys\u00a03\u00a0Then the Lord spoke to Jonah again and said,",
  "Jonah-3-2": "2\u00a0\u201cGo to that big city Nineveh, and say what I tell you.\u201d",
  "Jonah-3-3": "3\u00a0So Jonah obeyed the Lord and went to Nineveh. It was a very large city. A person had to walk for three days to travel through it.",
  "Jonah-3-4": "4\u00a0Jonah went to the center of the city and began speaking to the people. He said, \u201cAfter 40 days, Nineveh will be destroyed!\u201d",
  "Jonah-3-5": "5\u00a0The people of Nineveh believed God. They decided to stop eating for a time to think about their sins. They put on special clothes to show they were sorry. All the people in the city did this, from the most important to the least important.",
  "Jonah-3-6": "6\u00a0When the king of Nineveh heard about this, he left his throne, removed his robe, put on special clothes to show that he was sorry, and sat in ashes.[a]",
  "Jonah-3-7": "7\u00a0The king wrote a special message and sent it throughout the city:\u00a0A command from the king and his great rulers:\u00a0For a short time no person or animal should eat anything. No herd or flock will be allowed in the fields. Nothing living in Nineveh will eat or drink water.",
  "Jonah-3-8": "8\u00a0But every person and every animal must be covered with a special cloth to show they are sad. People must cry loudly to God. Everyone must change their life and stop doing bad things.",
  "Jonah-3-9": "9\u00a0Who knows? Maybe God will stop being angry and change his mind, and we will not be punished.",
  "Jonah-3-10": "10\u00a0God saw what the people did. He saw that they stopped doing evil. So God changed his mind and did not do what he planned. He did not punish the people.",
  "Jonah-4-1": "God\u2019s Mercy Makes Jonah Angry\u00a04\u00a0Jonah was not happy that God saved the city. Jonah became angry.",
  "Jonah-4-2": "2\u00a0He complained to the Lord and said, \u201cLord, I knew this would happen! I was in my own country, and you told me to come here. At that time I knew that you would forgive the people of this evil city, so I decided to run away to Tarshish. I knew that you are a kind God. I knew that you show mercy and don\u2019t want to punish people. I knew that you are kind, and if these people stopped sinning, you would change your plans to destroy them.",
  "Jonah-4-3": "3\u00a0So now, Lord, just kill me. It is better for me to die than to live.\u201d",
  "Jonah-4-4": "4\u00a0Then the Lord said, \u201cDo you think it is right for you to be angry?\u201d",
  "Jonah-4-5": "5\u00a0Jonah went out of the city to a place near the city on the east side. He made a shelter for himself and sat there in the shade, waiting to see what would happen to the city.",
  "Jonah-4-6": "The Gourd Plant and the Worm\u00a06\u00a0The Lord made a gourd plant grow quickly over Jonah. This made a cool place for Jonah to sit and helped him to be more comfortable. He was very happy because of this plant.",
  "Jonah-4-7": "7\u00a0The next morning, God sent a worm to eat part of the plant. The worm began eating the plant, and the plant died.",
  "Jonah-4-8": "8\u00a0After the sun was high in the sky, God caused a hot east wind to blow. The sun became very hot on Jonah\u2019s head, and he became very weak. He asked God to let him die. He said, \u201cIt is better for me to die than to live.\u201d",
  "Jonah-4-9": "9\u00a0But God said to Jonah, \u201cDo you think it is right for you to be angry just because this plant died?\u201d\u00a0Jonah answered, \u201cYes, it is right for me to be angry! I am angry enough to die!\u201d",
  "Jonah-4-10": "10\u00a0And the Lord said, \u201cYou did nothing for that plant. You did not make it grow. It grew up in the night, and the next day it died. And now you are sad about it.",
  "Jonah-4-11": "11\u00a0If you can get upset over a plant, surely I can feel sorry for a big city like Nineveh. There are many people and animals in that city. There are more than 120,000 people there who did not know they were doing wrong.\u201d[a]"
