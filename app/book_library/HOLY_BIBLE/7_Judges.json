  "Judges-3-20": "20\u00a0Ehud went to King Eglon. The king was sitting all alone in the upper room of his palace.\u00a0Then Ehud said, \u201cI have a message from God for you.\u201d The king stood up from his throne. He was very close to Ehud.",
  "Judges-3-21": "21\u00a0As the king was getting up from his throne,[e] Ehud reached with his left hand and took out the sword that was tied to his right thigh. Then he pushed the sword into the king\u2019s belly.",

  "Judges-4-7": "7\u00a0I will make Sisera, the commander of King Jabin\u2019s army, come to you. I will make Sisera, his chariots, and his army come to the Kishon River.[a] I will help you defeat Sisera there.\u2019\u201d",
  "Judges-4-8": "8\u00a0Then Barak said to Deborah, \u201cI will go and do this if you will go with me. But if you will not go with me, I will not go.\u201d",
  "Judges-4-9": "9\u00a0\u201cOf course I will go with you,\u201d Deborah answered. \u201cBut because of your attitude, you will not be honored when Sisera is defeated. The Lord will allow a woman to defeat Sisera.\u201d\u00a0So Deborah went with Barak to the city of Kedesh.",

  "Judges-4-14": "14\u00a0Then Deborah said to Barak, \u201cToday the Lord will help you defeat Sisera. Surely you know that the Lord has already cleared the way for you.\u201d So Barak led the 10,000 men down from Mount Tabor.",
  "Judges-4-15": "15\u00a0Barak and his men attacked Sisera. During the battle, the Lord confused Sisera and his army and chariots. They did not know what to do. Barak and his men defeated Sisera\u2019s army, but Sisera left his chariot and ran away on foot.",
  "Judges-4-16": "16\u00a0Barak continued fighting Sisera\u2019s army. He and his men chased Sisera\u2019s chariots and army all the way to Harosheth Haggoyim. They used their swords to kill all of Sisera\u2019s men. Not one of Sisera\u2019s men was left alive.",
  "Judges-4-17": "17\u00a0But Sisera ran away to the tent where a woman named Jael lived. Jael was the wife of Heber the Kenite. His family was at peace with King Jabin of Hazor. That is why Sisera ran to Jael\u2019s tent.",
  "Judges-4-18": "18\u00a0Jael saw him coming, so she went out to meet him and said, \u201cSir, come into my tent. Come in. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d So Sisera went into Jael\u2019s tent, and she covered him with a blanket.",

  "Judges-4-21": "21\u00a0But Jael found a tent peg and a hammer. She quietly went to Sisera. Sisera was very tired, so he was sleeping. She put the tent peg to the side of Sisera\u2019s head and hit it with a hammer. The tent peg went through the side of his head and into the ground. Sisera died.",
  "Judges-4-22": "22\u00a0Just then Barak came by Jael\u2019s tent, looking for Sisera. Jael went out to meet Barak and said, \u201cCome in here, and I will show you the man you are looking for.\u201d So Barak entered the tent with Jael.

  "Judges-8-3": "3\u00a0In the same way you have a better harvest now. God allowed you to capture Oreb and Zeeb, the leaders of Midian. How can I compare my success with what you did?\u201d When the men of Ephraim heard Gideon\u2019s answer, they were not as angry as they had been.",

  "Judges-15-11": "11\u00a0Then 3000 men from the tribe of Judah went to the cave near the Rock of Etam and said to Samson, \u201cWhat have you done to us? Don\u2019t you know that the Philistines rule over us?\u201d\u00a0Samson answered, \u201cI only punished them for what they did to me.\u201d",
  "Judges-15-12": "12\u00a0Then they said to Samson, \u201cWe have come to tie you up. We will give you to the Philistines.\u201d\u00a0Samson said to the men from Judah, \u201cPromise me that you yourselves will not hurt me.\u201d",
  "Judges-15-13": "13\u00a0The men from Judah said, \u201cWe agree. We will just tie you up and give you to the Philistines. We promise that we will not kill you.\u201d So they tied Samson with two new ropes and led him up from the cave in the rock.",

  "Judges-21-22": "22\u00a0The fathers or brothers of the young women will come and complain to us. But we will say, \u2018Be kind to the men of Benjamin. Let them marry the women.

  "Judges-21-23": "23\u00a0So that is what the men of the tribe of Benjamin did. While the young women were dancing, each man caught one of them. They took them away and married them. Then they went back to their land. The men of Benjamin built cities again in that land, and they lived in them.",
