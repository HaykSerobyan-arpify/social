  "Ephesians-1-9": "9\u00a0he let us know his secret plan. This was what God wanted, and he planned to do it through Christ.",
  "Ephesians-1-10": "10\u00a0God\u2019s goal was to finish his plan when the right time came. He planned that all things in heaven and on earth be joined together with Christ as the head.",
  "Ephesians-1-11": "11\u00a0In Christ we were chosen to be God\u2019s people. God had already planned for us to be his people, because that is what he wanted. And he is the one who makes everything agree with what he decides and wants.",
  "Ephesians-1-12": "12\u00a0We Jews were the first to hope in Christ. And we were chosen so that we would bring praise to God in all his glory.",
  "Ephesians-1-13": "13\u00a0It is the same with you. You heard the true message, the Good News about the way God saves you. When you heard that Good News, you believed in Christ. And in Christ, God put his special mark on you by giving you the Holy Spirit that he promised.",
  "Ephesians-1-14": "14\u00a0The Spirit is the first payment that guarantees we will get all that God has for us. Then we will enjoy complete freedom as people who belong to him. The goal for all of us is the praise of God in all his glory.",

  "Ephesians-2-2": "2\u00a0Yes, in the past your lives were full of those sins. You lived the way the world lives, following the ruler of the evil powers[a] that are above the earth. That same spirit is now working in those who refuse to obey God.",
  "Ephesians-2-3": "3\u00a0In the past all of us lived like that, trying to please our sinful selves. We did all the things our bodies and minds wanted. Like everyone else in the world, we deserved to suffer God\u2019s anger just because of the way we were.",
  "Ephesians-2-4": "4\u00a0But God is rich in mercy, and he loved us very much.",
  "Ephesians-2-5": "5\u00a0We were spiritually dead because of all we had done against him. But he gave us new life together with Christ. (You have been saved by God\u2019s grace.)",
  "Ephesians-2-6": "6\u00a0Yes, it is because we are a part of Christ Jesus that God raised us from death and seated us together with him in the heavenly places.",
  "Ephesians-2-7": "7\u00a0God did this so that his kindness to us who belong to Christ Jesus would clearly show for all time to come the amazing richness of his grace.",
  "Ephesians-2-8": "8\u00a0I mean that you have been saved by grace because you believed. You did not save yourselves; it was a gift from God.",
  "Ephesians-2-9": "9\u00a0You are not saved by the things you have done, so there is nothing to boast about.",
  "Ephesians-2-10": "10\u00a0God has made us what we are. In Christ Jesus, God made us new people so that we would spend our lives doing the good things he had already planned for us to do.",
  "Ephesians-2-11": "One in Christ\u00a011\u00a0You were not born as Jews. You are the people the Jews call \u201cuncircumcised.[b]\u201d Those Jews who call you \u201cuncircumcised\u201d call themselves \u201ccircumcised.\u201d (Their circumcision is only something they themselves do to their bodies.)",
  "Ephesians-2-12": "12\u00a0Remember that in the past you were without Christ. You were not citizens of Israel, and you did not know about the agreements[c] with the promises that God made to his people. You had no hope, and you did not know God.",
  "Ephesians-2-13": "13\u00a0Yes, at one time you were far away from God, but now in Christ Jesus, you are brought near to him. You are brought near to God through the blood sacrifice of Christ.",
  "Ephesians-2-14": "14\u00a0Christ is the reason we are now at peace. He made us Jews and you who are not Jews one people. We were separated by a wall of hate that stood between us, but Christ broke down that wall. By giving his own body,",
  "Ephesians-2-15": "15\u00a0Christ ended the law with its many commands and rules. His purpose was to make the two groups become one in him. By doing this he would make peace.",
  "Ephesians-2-16": "16\u00a0Through the cross Christ ended the hate between the two groups. And after they became one body, he wanted to bring them both back to God. He did this with his death on the cross.",

  "Ephesians-2-18": "18\u00a0Yes, through Christ we all have the right to come to the Father in one Spirit.",
  "Ephesians-2-19": "19\u00a0So now you non-Jewish people are not visitors or strangers, but you are citizens together with God\u2019s holy people. You belong to God\u2019s family.",
  "Ephesians-2-20": "20\u00a0You believers are like a building that God owns. That building was built on the foundation that the apostles and prophets prepared. Christ Jesus himself is the most important stone[d] in that building.",

  "Ephesians-3-1": "Paul\u2019s Work for the Non-Jewish People\u00a03\u00a0So I, Paul, am a prisoner because I serve Christ Jesus for you who are not Jews.",
  "Ephesians-3-2": "2\u00a0Surely you know that God gave me this work through his grace to help you.",
  "Ephesians-3-3": "3\u00a0God let me know his secret plan by showing it to me. I have already written a little about this.",
  "Ephesians-3-4": "4\u00a0And if you read what I wrote, you can see that I understand the secret truth about Christ.",
  "Ephesians-3-5": "5\u00a0People who lived in other times were not told that secret truth. But now, through the Spirit, God has made it known to his holy apostles and prophets.",
  "Ephesians-3-6": "6\u00a0And this is the secret truth: that by hearing the Good News, those who are not Jews will share with the Jews in the blessings God has for his people. They are part of the same body, and they share in the promise God made through Christ Jesus.",
  "Ephesians-3-7": "7\u00a0By God\u2019s special gift of grace, I became a servant to tell that Good News. He gave me that grace by using his power.",
  "Ephesians-3-8": "8\u00a0I am the least important of all God\u2019s people. But he gave me this gift\u2014to tell the non-Jewish people the Good News about the riches Christ has. These riches are too great to understand fully.",
  "Ephesians-3-9": "9\u00a0And God gave me the work of telling all people about the plan for his secret truth. That secret truth has been hidden in him since the beginning of time. He is the one who created everything.",
  "Ephesians-3-10": "10\u00a0His purpose was that all the rulers and powers in the heavenly places will now know the many different ways he shows his wisdom. They will know this because of the church.",
  "Ephesians-3-11": "11\u00a0This agrees with the plan God had since the beginning of time. He did what he planned, and he did it through Christ Jesus our Lord.",
  "Ephesians-3-12": "12\u00a0In Christ we come before God with freedom and without fear. We can do this because of our faith in Christ.",
  "Ephesians-3-13": "13\u00a0So I ask you not to be discouraged because of what is happening to me. My sufferings are for your benefit\u2014for your honor and glory.",

  "Ephesians-3-16": "16\u00a0I ask the Father with his great glory to give you the power to be strong in your spirits. He will give you that strength through his Spirit.",
  "Ephesians-3-17": "17\u00a0I pray that Christ will live in your hearts because of your faith. I pray that your life will be strong in love and be built on love.",
  "Ephesians-3-18": "18\u00a0And I pray that you and all God\u2019s holy people will have the power to understand the greatness of Christ\u2019s love\u2014how wide, how long, how high, and how deep that love is.",
  "Ephesians-3-19": "19\u00a0Christ\u2019s love is greater than anyone can ever know, but I pray that you will be able to know that love. Then you can be filled with everything God has for you.",
  "Ephesians-3-20": "20\u00a0With God\u2019s power working in us, he can do much, much more than anything we can ask or think of.",
  "Ephesians-3-21": "21\u00a0To him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus for all time, forever and ever. Amen.",
  "Ephesians-4-1": "The Unity of the Body\u00a04\u00a0So, as a prisoner for the Lord, I beg you to live the way God\u2019s people should live, because he chose you to be his.",
  "Ephesians-4-2": "2\u00a0Always be humble and gentle. Be patient and accept each other with love.",
  "Ephesians-4-3": "3\u00a0You are joined together with peace through the Spirit. Do all you can to continue as you are, letting peace hold you together.",
  "Ephesians-4-4": "4\u00a0There is one body and one Spirit, and God chose you to have one hope.",
  "Ephesians-4-5": "5\u00a0There is one Lord, one faith, and one baptism.",
  "Ephesians-4-6": "6\u00a0There is one God and Father of us all, who rules over everyone. He works through all of us and in all of us.",
  "Ephesians-4-7": "7\u00a0Christ gave each one of us a special gift. Everyone received what he wanted to give them.",
  "Ephesians-4-8": "8\u00a0That is why the Scriptures say,\u00a0\u201cHe went up high into the sky;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0he took prisoners with him,\u00a0he took prisoners with him,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and he gave gifts to people.\u201d (A)\u00a0and he gave gifts to people.\u201d (A)",
  "Ephesians-4-9": "9\u00a0When it says, \u201cHe went up,\u201d what does it mean? It means that he first came down low to earth.",
  "Ephesians-4-10": "10\u00a0So Christ came down, and he is the same one who went up. He went up above the highest heaven in order to fill everything with himself.",
  "Ephesians-4-11": "11\u00a0And that same Christ gave these gifts to people: He made some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to go and tell the Good News, and some to care for and teach God\u2019s people.[a]",
  "Ephesians-4-12": "12\u00a0Christ gave these gifts to prepare God\u2019s holy people for the work of serving, to make the body of Christ stronger.",
  "Ephesians-4-13": "13\u00a0This work must continue until we are all joined together in what we believe and in what we know about the Son of God. Our goal is to become like a full-grown man\u2014to look just like Christ and have all his perfection.",
  "Ephesians-4-14": "14\u00a0Then we will no longer be like babies. We will not be people who are always changing like a ship that the waves carry one way and then another. We will not be influenced by every new teaching we hear from people who are trying to deceive us\u2014those who make clever plans and use every kind of trick to fool others into following the wrong way.",
  "Ephesians-4-15": "15\u00a0No, we will speak the truth with love. We will grow to be like Christ in every way. He is the head,",
  "Ephesians-4-16": "16\u00a0and the whole body depends on him. All the parts of the body are joined and held together, with each part doing its own work. This causes the whole body to grow and to be stronger in love.",
  "Ephesians-4-17": "The Way You Should Live\u00a017\u00a0I have something from the Lord to tell you. I warn you: Don\u2019t continue living like those who don\u2019t believe. Their thoughts are worth nothing.",
  "Ephesians-4-18": "18\u00a0They have no understanding, and they know nothing because they refuse to listen. So they cannot have the life that God gives.",
  "Ephesians-4-19": "19\u00a0They have lost their feeling of shame and use their lives to do what is morally wrong. More and more they want to do all kinds of evil.",
  "Ephesians-4-20": "20\u00a0But that way of life is nothing like what you learned when you came to know Christ.",
  "Ephesians-4-21": "21\u00a0I know that you heard about him, and in him you were taught the truth. Yes, the truth is in Jesus.",
  "Ephesians-4-22": "22\u00a0You were taught to leave your old self. This means that you must stop living the evil way you lived before. That old self gets worse and worse, because people are fooled by the evil they want to do.",
  "Ephesians-4-23": "23\u00a0You must be made new in your hearts and in your thinking.",
  "Ephesians-4-24": "24\u00a0Be that new person who was made to be like God, truly good and pleasing to him.",
  "Ephesians-4-25": "25\u00a0So you must stop telling lies. \u201cYou must always speak the truth to each other,\u201d[b] because we all belong to each other in the same body.",
  "Ephesians-4-26": "26\u00a0\u201cWhen you are angry, don\u2019t let that anger make you sin,\u201d[c] and don\u2019t stay angry all day.",
  "Ephesians-4-27": "27\u00a0Don\u2019t give the devil a way to defeat you.",
  "Ephesians-4-28": "28\u00a0Whoever has been stealing must stop it and start working. They must use their hands for doing something good. Then they will have something to share with those who are poor.",
  "Ephesians-4-29": "29\u00a0When you talk, don\u2019t say anything bad. But say the good things that people need\u2014whatever will help them grow stronger. Then what you say will be a blessing to those who hear you.",
  "Ephesians-4-30": "30\u00a0And don\u2019t make the Holy Spirit sad. God gave you his Spirit as proof that you belong to him and that he will keep you safe until the day he makes you free.",
  "Ephesians-4-31": "31\u00a0Never be bitter, angry, or mad. Never shout angrily or say things to hurt others. Never do anything evil.",
  "Ephesians-4-32": "32\u00a0Be kind and loving to each other. Forgive each other the same as God forgave you through Christ.",
  "Ephesians-5-1": "5\u00a0You are God\u2019s dear children, so try to be like him.",
  "Ephesians-5-2": "2\u00a0Live a life of love. Love others just as Christ loved us. He gave himself for us\u2014a sweet-smelling offering and sacrifice to God.",
  "Ephesians-5-3": "3\u00a0But there must be no sexual sin among you. There must not be any kind of evil or selfishly wanting more and more, because such things are not right for God\u2019s holy people.",
  "Ephesians-5-4": "4\u00a0Also, there must be no evil talk among you. Don\u2019t say things that are foolish or filthy. These are not for you. But you should be giving thanks to God.",
  "Ephesians-5-5": "5\u00a0You can be sure of this: No one will have a place in the kingdom of Christ and of God if that person commits sexual sins, or does evil things, or is a person who selfishly wants more and more. A greedy person like that is serving a false god.",
  "Ephesians-5-6": "6\u00a0Don\u2019t let anyone fool you with words that are not true. God gets very angry when people who don\u2019t obey him talk like that.",
  "Ephesians-5-7": "7\u00a0So don\u2019t have anything to do with them.",
  "Ephesians-5-8": "8\u00a0In the past you were full of darkness, but now you are full of light in the Lord. So live like children who belong to the light.",
  "Ephesians-5-9": "9\u00a0This light produces every kind of goodness, right living, and truth.",
  "Ephesians-5-10": "10\u00a0Try to learn what pleases the Lord.",
  "Ephesians-5-11": "11\u00a0Have no part in the things that people in darkness do, which produce nothing good. Instead, tell everyone how wrong those things are.",
  "Ephesians-5-12": "12\u00a0Actually, it is shameful to even talk about the things those people do in secret.",
  "Ephesians-5-13": "13\u00a0But the light makes clear how wrong those things are.",
  "Ephesians-5-14": "14\u00a0Yes, everything is made clear by the light. This is why we say,\u00a0\u201cWake up, you who are sleeping!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rise from death,\u00a0Rise from death,\u00a0and Christ will shine on you.\u201d",
  "Ephesians-5-15": "15\u00a0So be very careful how you live. Live wisely, not like fools.",
  "Ephesians-5-16": "16\u00a0I mean that you should use every opportunity you have for doing good, because these are evil times.",
  "Ephesians-5-17": "17\u00a0So don\u2019t be foolish with your lives, but learn what the Lord wants you to do.",
  "Ephesians-5-18": "18\u00a0Don\u2019t be drunk with wine, which will ruin your life, but be filled with the Spirit.",
  "Ephesians-5-19": "19\u00a0Encourage each other with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your hearts to the Lord.",
  "Ephesians-5-20": "20\u00a0Always give thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "Ephesians-5-21": "Wives and Husbands\u00a021\u00a0Be willing to serve each other out of respect for Christ.",
  "Ephesians-5-22": "22\u00a0Wives, be willing to serve your husbands the same as the Lord.",
  "Ephesians-5-23": "23\u00a0A husband is the head of his wife, just as Christ is the head of the church. Christ is the Savior of the church, which is his body.",
  "Ephesians-5-24": "24\u00a0The church serves under Christ, so it is the same with you wives. You should be willing to serve your husbands in everything.",
  "Ephesians-5-25": "25\u00a0Husbands, love your wives the same as Christ loved the church and gave his life for it.",
  "Ephesians-5-26": "26\u00a0He died to make the church holy. He used the telling of the Good News to make the church clean by washing it with water.",
  "Ephesians-5-27": "27\u00a0Christ died so that he could give the church to himself like a bride in all her beauty. He died so that the church could be holy and without fault, with no evil or sin or any other thing wrong in it.",
  "Ephesians-5-28": "28\u00a0And husbands should love their wives like that. They should love their wives as they love their own bodies. The man who loves his wife loves himself,",
  "Ephesians-5-29": "29\u00a0because no one ever hates his own body, but feeds and takes care of it. And that is what Christ does for the church",
  "Ephesians-5-30": "30\u00a0because we are parts of his body.",
  "Ephesians-5-31": "31\u00a0The Scriptures say, \u201cThat is why a man will leave his father and mother and join his wife, and the two people will become one.\u201d[a]",
  "Ephesians-5-32": "32\u00a0That secret truth is very important\u2014I am talking about Christ and the church.",
  "Ephesians-5-33": "33\u00a0But each one of you must love his wife as he loves himself. And a wife must respect her husband.",
  "Ephesians-6-1": "Children and Parents\u00a06\u00a0Children, obey your parents the way the Lord wants, because this is the right thing to do.",
  "Ephesians-6-2": "2\u00a0The command says, \u201cYou must respect your father and mother.\u201d[a] This is the first command that has a promise with it.",
  "Ephesians-6-3": "3\u00a0And this is the promise: \u201cThen all will go well with you, and you will have a long life on the earth.\u201d[b]",
  "Ephesians-6-4": "4\u00a0Fathers, don\u2019t make your children angry, but raise them with the kind of teaching and training you learn from the Lord.",
  "Ephesians-6-5": "Slaves and Masters\u00a05\u00a0Slaves, obey your masters here on earth with fear and respect. And do this with a heart that is true, just as you obey Christ.",
  "Ephesians-6-6": "6\u00a0You must do this not just to please your masters while they are watching, but all the time. Since you are really slaves of Christ, you must do with all your heart what God wants.",
  "Ephesians-6-7": "7\u00a0Do your work, and be happy to do it. Work as though it is the Lord you are serving, not just an earthly master.",
  "Ephesians-6-8": "8\u00a0Remember that the Lord will give everyone a reward for doing good. Everyone, slave or free, will get a reward for the good things they do.",
  "Ephesians-6-9": "9\u00a0Masters, in the same way, be good to your slaves. Don\u2019t say things to scare them. You know that the one who is your Master and their Master is in heaven, and he treats everyone the same.",

  "Ephesians-6-11": "11\u00a0Wear the full armor of God. Wear God\u2019s armor so that you can fight against the devil\u2019s clever tricks.",
  "Ephesians-6-12": "12\u00a0Our fight is not against people on earth. We are fighting against the rulers and authorities and the powers of this world\u2019s darkness. We are fighting against the spiritual powers of evil in the heavenly places.",
  "Ephesians-6-13": "13\u00a0That is why you need to get God\u2019s full armor. Then on the day of evil, you will be able to stand strong. And when you have finished the whole fight, you will still be standing.",
  "Ephesians-6-14": "14\u00a0So stand strong with the belt of truth tied around your waist, and on your chest wear the protection of right living.",

  "Ephesians-6-22": "22\u00a0That\u2019s why I am sending him\u2014to let you know how we are and to encourage you.",
  "Ephesians-6-23": "23\u00a0I pray that God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will give peace and love with faith to all the brothers and sisters there.",
  "Ephesians-6-24": "24\u00a0God\u2019s grace to all of you who love our Lord Jesus Christ with love that never ends."
