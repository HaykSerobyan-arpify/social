  "1Corinthians-7-34": "34\u00a0He must think about two things\u2014pleasing his wife and pleasing the Lord. A woman who is not married or a girl who has never married is busy with the Lord\u2019s work. She wants to give herself fully\u2014body and spirit\u2014to the Lord. But a married woman is busy with things of the world. She is trying to please her husband.",
  "1Corinthians-7-35": "35\u00a0I am saying this to help you. I am not trying to limit you, but I want you to live in the right way. And I want you to give yourselves fully to the Lord without giving your time to other things.",

  "1Corinthians-7-37": "37\u00a0But another man might be more sure in his mind. There may be no need for marriage, so he is free to do what he wants. If he has decided in his own heart not to marry his fianc\u00e9e, he is doing the right thing.",
  "1Corinthians-7-38": "38\u00a0So the man who marries his fianc\u00e9e does right, and the man who does not marry does better.",

  "1Corinthians-8-8": "8\u00a0But food will not bring us closer to God. Refusing to eat does not make us less pleasing to God, and eating does not make us closer to him.",
  "1Corinthians-8-9": "9\u00a0But be careful with your freedom. Your freedom to eat anything may make those who have doubts about what they can eat fall into sin.",
  "1Corinthians-8-10": "10\u00a0You understand that it\u2019s all right to eat anything, so you can eat even in an idol\u2019s temple. But someone who has doubts might see you eating there, and this might encourage them to eat meat sacrificed to idols too. But they really think it is wrong.",
  "1Corinthians-8-11": "11\u00a0So this weak brother or sister\u2014someone Christ died for\u2014is lost because of your better understanding.",
  "1Corinthians-8-12": "12\u00a0When you sin against your brothers and sisters in Christ in this way and you hurt them by causing them to do things they feel are wrong, you are also sinning against Christ.",

  "1Corinthians-9-10": "10\u00a0He was really talking about us. Yes, that was written for us. The one who plows and the one who separates the grain should both expect to get some of the grain for their work.",

If they can interpret, then the church can be helped by what they say.",
  "1Corinthians-14-6": "6\u00a0Brothers and sisters, will it help you if I come to you speaking in different languages? No, it will help you only if I bring you a new truth or some knowledge, prophecy, or teaching.",

  "1Corinthians-14-11": "11\u00a0But if I don\u2019t understand the meaning of what someone is saying, it will just be strange sounds to me, and I will sound just as strange to them.",
  "1Corinthians-14-12": "12\u00a0That\u2019s why you who want spiritual gifts so much should prefer those gifts that help the church grow stronger.",
  "1Corinthians-14-13": "13\u00a0So those who have the gift of speaking in a different language should pray that they can also interpret what they say.",
  "1Corinthians-14-14": "14\u00a0If I pray in a different language, my spirit is praying, but my mind does nothing.",
  "1Corinthians-14-15": "15\u00a0So what should I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind.",
  "1Corinthians-14-16": "16\u00a0You might be praising God with your spirit. But someone there without understanding cannot say \u201cAmen\u201d to your prayer of thanks, because they don\u2019t know what you are saying.",
  "1Corinthians-14-17": "17\u00a0You may be thanking God in a good way, but others are not helped.",
  "1Corinthians-14-18": "18\u00a0I thank God that my gift of speaking in different kinds of languages is greater than any of yours.",
  "1Corinthians-14-19": "19\u00a0But in the church meetings I would rather speak five words that I understand than thousands of words in a different language. I would rather speak with my understanding, so that I can teach others.",
  "1Corinthians-14-20": "20\u00a0Brothers and sisters, don\u2019t think like children. In evil things be like babies, but in your thinking you should be like full-grown adults.",

  "1Corinthians-14-22": "22\u00a0And from this we see that the use of different languages shows how God deals with those who don\u2019t believe, not with those who believe. And prophecy shows how God works through those who believe, not through unbelievers.",
  "1Corinthians-14-23": "23\u00a0Suppose the whole church meets together and you all speak in different languages. If some people come in who are without understanding or don\u2019t believe, they will say you are crazy.",
  "1Corinthians-14-24": "24\u00a0But suppose you are all prophesying and someone comes in who does not believe or who is without understanding. Their sin will be shown to them, and they will be judged by everything you say.",
  "1Corinthians-14-25": "25\u00a0The secret things in their heart will be made known. So they will bow down and worship God. They will say, \u201cWithout a doubt, God is here with you.\u201d[b]",
  "1Corinthians-14-26": "Your Meetings Should Be Helpful to All\u00a026\u00a0So, brothers and sisters, what should you do? When you meet together, one person has a song, another has a teaching, and another has a new truth from God. One person speaks in a different language, and another interprets that language. The purpose of whatever you do should be to help everyone grow stronger in faith.",
  "1Corinthians-14-27": "27\u00a0When you meet together, if anyone speaks to the group in a different language, it should be only two or no more than three people who do this. And they should speak one after the other. And someone else should interpret what they say.",
  "1Corinthians-14-28": "28\u00a0But if there is no interpreter, then anyone who speaks in a different language should be quiet in the church meeting. They should speak only to themselves and to God.",
  "1Corinthians-14-29": "29\u00a0And only two or three prophets should speak. The others should judge what they say.",
  "1Corinthians-14-30": "30\u00a0And if a message from God comes to someone who is sitting, the first speaker should be quiet.",
  "1Corinthians-14-31": "31\u00a0You can all prophesy one after the other. This way everyone can be taught and encouraged.",
  "1Corinthians-14-32": "32\u00a0The spirits of prophets are under the control of the prophets themselves.",
  "1Corinthians-14-33": "33\u00a0God is not a God of confusion but a God of peace. This is the rule for all the meetings of God\u2019s people.",
  "1Corinthians-14-34": "34\u00a0The women should keep quiet in these church meetings. They are not allowed to speak out but should be under authority, as the Law of Moses says.",
  "1Corinthians-14-35": "35\u00a0If there is something they want to know, they should ask their own husbands at home. It is shameful for a woman to speak up like that in the church meeting.",
  "1Corinthians-14-36": "36\u00a0God\u2019s teaching did not come from you, and you are not the only ones who have received it.",
  "1Corinthians-14-37": "37\u00a0If you think you are a prophet or that you have a spiritual gift, you should understand that what I am writing to you is the Lord\u2019s command.",
  "1Corinthians-14-38": "38\u00a0If you do not accept this, you will not be accepted.",
  "1Corinthians-14-39": "39\u00a0So my brothers and sisters, continue to give your attention to prophesying. And don\u2019t stop anyone from using the gift of speaking in different languages.",
  "1Corinthians-14-40": "40\u00a0But everything should be done in a way that is right and orderly.",
  "1Corinthians-15-1": "The Good News About Jesus Christ\u00a015\u00a0Now, brothers and sisters, I want you to remember the Good News I told you. You received that Good News message, and you continue to base your life on it.",
  "1Corinthians-15-2": "2\u00a0That Good News, the message you heard from me, is God\u2019s way to save you. But you must continue believing it. If you don\u2019t, you believed for nothing.",
  "1Corinthians-15-3": "3\u00a0I gave you the message that I received. I told you the most important truths: that Christ died for our sins, as the Scriptures say;",
  "1Corinthians-15-4": "4\u00a0that he was buried and was raised to life on the third day, as the Scriptures say;",
  "1Corinthians-15-5": "5\u00a0and that he appeared to Peter and then to the twelve apostles.",
  "1Corinthians-15-6": "6\u00a0After that Christ appeared to more than 500 other believers at the same time. Most of them are still living today, but some have died.",
  "1Corinthians-15-7": "7\u00a0Then he appeared to James and later to all the apostles.",
  "1Corinthians-15-8": "8\u00a0Last of all, he appeared to me. I was different, like a baby born before the normal time.",
  "1Corinthians-15-9": "9\u00a0All the other apostles are greater than I am. I say this because I persecuted the church of God. That is why I am not even good enough to be called an apostle.",
  "1Corinthians-15-10": "10\u00a0But, because of God\u2019s grace, that is what I am. And his grace that he gave me was not wasted. I worked harder than all the other apostles. (But I was not really the one working. It was God\u2019s grace that was with me.)",
  "1Corinthians-15-11": "11\u00a0So then it is not important if I told you God\u2019s message or if it was the other apostles who told you\u2014we all tell people the same message, and this is what you believed.",
  "1Corinthians-15-12": "We Will Be Raised From Death\u00a012\u00a0We tell everyone that Christ was raised from death. So why do some of you say that people will not be raised from death?",
  "1Corinthians-15-13": "13\u00a0If no one will ever be raised from death, then Christ has never been raised.",
  "1Corinthians-15-14": "14\u00a0And if Christ has never been raised, then the message we tell is worth nothing. And your faith is worth nothing.",
  "1Corinthians-15-15": "15\u00a0And we will also be guilty of lying about God, because we have told people about him, saying that he raised Christ from death. And if no one is raised from death, then God never raised Christ from death.",
  "1Corinthians-15-16": "16\u00a0If those who have died are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either.",
  "1Corinthians-15-17": "17\u00a0And if Christ has not been raised from death, then your faith is for nothing; you are still guilty of your sins.",
  "1Corinthians-15-18": "18\u00a0And those in Christ who have already died are lost.",
  "1Corinthians-15-19": "19\u00a0If our hope in Christ is only for this life here on earth, then people should feel more sorry for us than for anyone else.",
  "1Corinthians-15-20": "20\u00a0But Christ really has been raised from death\u2014the first one of all those who will be raised.",
  "1Corinthians-15-21": "21\u00a0Death comes to people because of what one man did. But now there is resurrection from death because of another man.",
  "1Corinthians-15-22": "22\u00a0I mean that in Adam all of us die. And in the same way, in Christ all of us will be made alive again.",
  "1Corinthians-15-23": "23\u00a0But everyone will be raised to life in the right order. Christ was first to be raised. Then, when Christ comes again, those who belong to him will be raised to life.",

  "1Corinthians-15-28": "28\u00a0After everything has been put under Christ, then the Son himself will be put under God. God is the one who put everything under Christ. And Christ will be put under God so that God will be the complete ruler over everything.",
  "1Corinthians-15-29": "29\u00a0If no one will ever be raised from death, then what will the people do who are baptized for those who have died? If the dead are never raised, then why are people baptized for them?",

  "1Corinthians-15-31": "31\u00a0I face death every day. That is true, brothers and sisters, just as it is true that I am proud of what you are because of Christ Jesus our Lord.",
  "1Corinthians-15-32": "32\u00a0I fought wild animals in Ephesus. If I did that only for human reasons, then I have gained nothing. If we are not raised from death, \u201cLet us eat and drink, because tomorrow we die.\u201d[c]",
