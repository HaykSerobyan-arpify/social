  "Joshua-1-4": "4\u00a0All the land from the desert to Lebanon all the way to the great river (that is, the Euphrates River) and all the land of the Hittites will be yours. And all the land from here to the Mediterranean Sea in the west (that is, the place where the sun sets) will be within your borders.",
  "Joshua-1-5": "5\u00a0Just as I was with Moses, I will be with you. No one will be able to stop you all your life. I will not abandon you. I will never leave you.",
  "Joshua-1-6": "6\u00a0\u201cJoshua, you must be strong and brave! You must lead these people so that they can take their land. I promised their fathers that I would give them this land.",
  "Joshua-1-7": "7\u00a0But you must be strong and brave about obeying the commands my servant Moses gave you. If you follow his teachings exactly, you will be successful in everything you do.",
  "Joshua-1-8": "8\u00a0Always remember what is written in that book of law. Speak about that book and study it day and night. Then you can be sure to obey what is written there. If you do this, you will be wise and successful in everything you do.",

So he has given you this land east of the Jordan River. But now you must help your relatives get their land. Your wives and children can stay here with your animals. But all your fighting men must prepare for battle and lead the men of the other tribes across the river.",
  "Joshua-1-15": "15\u00a0The Lord has given you a place to live, and he will do the same for your brothers. But you must help them until they take control of the land the Lord your God is giving them. Then you can come back and settle here on the east side of the river.

  "Joshua-2-9": "9\u00a0She said, \u201cI know that the Lord has given this land to your people. You frighten us. Everyone living in this country is afraid of you.",
  "Joshua-2-10": "10\u00a0We are afraid because we have heard about the ways that the Lord helped you. We heard that he dried up the Red Sea when you came out of Egypt. We also heard what you did to the two Amorite kings, Sihon and Og. We heard how you destroyed those kings living east of the Jordan River.",
  "Joshua-2-11": "11\u00a0When we heard about this, we were very afraid. And now, not one of our men is brave enough to fight you, because the Lord your God rules the heavens above and the earth below!",

  "Joshua-2-17": "17\u00a0The men said to her, \u201cWe made a promise to you. But you must do one thing, or we will not be responsible for our promise.",
  "Joshua-2-18": "18\u00a0When we come back to this land, you must tie in your window this red rope you are using to help us escape. You must bring your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your family into your house with you.",
  "Joshua-2-19": "19\u00a0We will protect everyone who stays in this house. If anyone in your house is hurt, we will be responsible. But if they go out of your house and are killed, we will not be responsible. It will be their own fault.",
  "Joshua-2-20": "20\u00a0We are making this agreement with you. But if you tell anyone about what we are doing, we will be free from this agreement.\u201d",
  "Joshua-2-21": "21\u00a0Rahab answered, \u201cI will do just what you said.\u201d She said goodbye, and the men left her house. Then she tied the red rope in the window.",
  "Joshua-2-22": "22\u00a0The men left her house and went into the hills. They stayed there for three days. The king\u2019s men looked all along the road. After three days, they stopped looking and went back to the city.",
  "Joshua-2-23": "23\u00a0Then the two men went back to Joshua. They left the hills and crossed the river. They went to Joshua and told him everything that they had learned.",
  "Joshua-2-24": "24\u00a0They said to him, \u201cThe Lord really has given us all the land. All the people in that country are afraid of us.\u201d",
  "Joshua-3-1": "Miracle at the Jordan River\u00a03\u00a0Early the next morning, Joshua and all the Israelites got up and left Acacia. They traveled to the Jordan River and camped there before they crossed it.",

  "Joshua-3-3": "3\u00a0They gave orders to the people: \u201cWhen you see the Levite priests carrying the Box of the Agreement of the Lord your God, follow them.",
  "Joshua-3-4": "4\u00a0But do not follow too closely. Stay about 1000 yards[a] behind them. You have not been here before, but if you follow them, you will know where to go.\u201d",
  "Joshua-3-5": "5\u00a0Then Joshua told the people, \u201cMake yourselves pure. Tomorrow the Lord will do amazing things among us.\u201d",
  "Joshua-3-6": "6\u00a0Then Joshua said to the priests, \u201cTake the Box of the Agreement and go across the river in front of the people.\u201d So the priests lifted the Box and carried it in front of the people.",
  "Joshua-3-7": "7\u00a0Then the Lord said to Joshua, \u201cToday I will begin to make you a great man for all the Israelites to see. Then the people will know that I am with you just as I was with Moses.",
  "Joshua-3-8": "8\u00a0The priests will carry the Box of the Agreement. Tell them this, \u2018Walk to the shore of the Jordan River and stop just before you step into the water.\u2019\u201d",
  "Joshua-3-9": "9\u00a0Then Joshua said to the Israelites, \u201cCome and listen to the words of the Lord your God.",
  "Joshua-3-10": "10\u00a0Here is proof that the living God is really with you and that he will surely defeat your enemies. He will defeat the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites; he will force them to leave their land.",
  "Joshua-3-11": "11\u00a0The Box of the Agreement of the Lord of the whole world will go before you as you cross the Jordan River.",
  "Joshua-3-12": "12\u00a0Now choose twelve men, one from each of the twelve tribes of Israel.",
  "Joshua-3-13": "13\u00a0The priests will carry the Holy Box of the Lord. He is the Lord of the whole world. They will carry that Box in front of you into the Jordan River. When they enter the water, the water of the Jordan River will stop flowing and fill behind that place like at a dam.\u201d",
  "Joshua-3-14": "14\u00a0The priests carried the Box of the Agreement, and the people left the place they had camped. The people started going across the Jordan River.",
  "Joshua-3-15": "15\u00a0(During harvest time the Jordan River overflows its banks, so the river was at its fullest.) The priests who were carrying the Box came to the shore of the river. When they stepped into the water,",
  "Joshua-3-16": "16\u00a0immediately the water stopped flowing and piled up like a wall. The water piled up high a long way up the river\u2014all the way to Adam (a town near Zarethan). And the water flowing down to the sea of Arabah (the Dead Sea) was completely cut off. The people crossed the river near Jericho.",
  "Joshua-3-17": "17\u00a0The ground at that place became dry, and the priests carried the Box of the Agreement of the Lord to the middle of the river and stopped. They waited there while all the Israelites walked across the Jordan River on dry land.",
  "Joshua-4-1": "Rocks to Remind the People\u00a04\u00a0After all the people had crossed the Jordan River, the Lord said to Joshua,",
  "Joshua-4-2": "2\u00a0\u201cChoose twelve men, one from each tribe.",
  "Joshua-4-3": "3\u00a0Tell them to look in the river where the priests were standing and get twelve rocks from that place. Carry these rocks with you and put them where you stay tonight.\u201d",
  "Joshua-4-4": "4\u00a0So Joshua chose one man from each tribe. Then he called the twelve men together.",
  "Joshua-4-5": "5\u00a0He said to them, \u201cGo out into the river where the Holy Box of the Lord your God is. Each of you must find one rock. There will be one rock for each of the twelve tribes of Israel. Carry that rock on your shoulder.",
  "Joshua-4-6": "6\u00a0These rocks will be a sign for you. In the future, your children will ask you, \u2018What do these rocks mean?\u2019",
  "Joshua-4-7": "7\u00a0You will tell them that the Lord stopped the water from flowing in the Jordan River. When the Holy Box of the Lord\u2019s Agreement crossed the river, the water stopped flowing. These rocks will help the Israelites remember this forever.\u201d",
  "Joshua-4-8": "8\u00a0So the Israelites obeyed Joshua. They carried twelve rocks from the middle of the Jordan River. There was one rock for each of the twelve tribes of Israel. They did this as the Lord had commanded Joshua. The men carried the rocks with them. Then they put the rocks at the place where they made their camp.",
  "Joshua-4-9": "9\u00a0Joshua also put twelve rocks in the middle of the Jordan River. He put them at the place where the priests had stood while carrying the Holy Box. These rocks are still there today.",
  "Joshua-4-10": "10\u00a0The Lord had commanded Joshua to tell the people what to do. This is what Moses had said Joshua must do. So the priests carrying the Holy Box stood in the middle of the river until everything was done. Meanwhile, the people hurried across the river.",
  "Joshua-4-11": "11\u00a0After the people finished crossing the river, the priests carried the Lord\u2019s Holy Box to the front of the people.",
  "Joshua-4-12": "12\u00a0The men from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh obeyed Moses. These men crossed the river in front of the other people. These men were prepared for war. They were going to help the rest of the Israelites take the land God had promised to give them.",
  "Joshua-4-13": "13\u00a0About 40,000 soldiers, prepared for war, passed before the Lord. They were marching toward the plains of Jericho.",
  "Joshua-4-14": "14\u00a0That day the Lord made Joshua a great man to all the Israelites. From that time on, they respected Joshua just as they had Moses.",
  "Joshua-4-15": "15\u00a0Then the Lord said to Joshua,",
  "Joshua-4-16": "16\u00a0\u201cCommand the priests carrying the Box that holds the Agreement[a] to come out of the river.\u201d",
  "Joshua-4-17": "17\u00a0So Joshua commanded the priests, \u201cCome out of the Jordan River.\u201d",
  "Joshua-4-18": "18\u00a0The priests obeyed Joshua. They carried the Box of the Lord\u2019s Agreement with them and came out of the river. When their feet touched the land on the other side of the river, the water in the river began flowing again. The water again overflowed its banks just as it had before the people crossed.",
  "Joshua-4-19": "19\u00a0The people crossed the Jordan River on the tenth day of the first month and camped at Gilgal, east of Jericho.",
  "Joshua-4-20": "20\u00a0They carried with them the twelve rocks that they had taken from the Jordan River, and Joshua set them up at Gilgal.",
  "Joshua-4-21": "21\u00a0Then Joshua told the Israelites, \u201cIn the future your children will ask you, \u2018What do these rocks mean?\u2019",
  "Joshua-4-22": "22\u00a0Tell them, \u2018These rocks help us remember the way the people of Israel crossed the Jordan River on dry land.\u2019",
  "Joshua-4-23": "23\u00a0The Lord your God caused the water in the Jordan River to stop flowing so that you could cross it on dry land\u2014just as the Lord had stopped the water at the Red Sea so that we could cross it on dry land.",
  "Joshua-4-24": "24\u00a0The Lord did this so that all the people in this country would know that he is very powerful. Then they will always be afraid of the Lord your God.\u201d",
  "Joshua-5-1": "5\u00a0So the Lord dried up the Jordan River until the Israelites finished crossing it. The kings of the Amorites living west of the Jordan River and the Canaanites living by the Mediterranean Sea heard about this and became very frightened. After that they were not brave enough to stand and fight against the Israelites.",
  "Joshua-5-2": "The Israelites Are Circumcised\u00a02\u00a0At that time the Lord said to Joshua, \u201cMake knives from flint rocks and circumcise the men of Israel.\u201d",
  "Joshua-5-3": "3\u00a0So Joshua made knives from flint rocks and circumcised the men of Israel at Gibeath Haaraloth.[a]",
  "Joshua-5-4-Josh-5-7": "4-7\u00a0This is why Joshua circumcised the men: After the Israelites left Egypt, all the men who were able to serve in the army were circumcised. While in the desert, many of the fighting men did not listen to the Lord. So the Lord promised that they would not see the \u201cland where much food grows.\u201d He promised our ancestors to give us that land, but because of those men, he forced the people to wander in the desert for 40 years. That way all those fighting men would die. So all the fighting men died, and their sons took their place. But none of the boys who were born in the desert on the trip from Egypt had been circumcised. So Joshua circumcised them.",
  "Joshua-5-8": "8\u00a0Joshua finished circumcising all the men. The people camped at that place until all the men were healed.",
  "Joshua-5-9": "First Passover in Canaan\u00a09\u00a0Then the Lord said to Joshua, \u201cYou were slaves in Egypt, and this made you ashamed. But today I have taken away that shame.\u201d So Joshua named that place Gilgal.[b] And that place is still named Gilgal today.",
  "Joshua-5-10": "10\u00a0The Israelites celebrated Passover while they were camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho. This was on the evening of the 14th day of the month.",
  "Joshua-5-11": "11\u00a0The day after Passover, the people ate food that grew in that land. They ate bread made without yeast and roasted grain.",
  "Joshua-5-12": "12\u00a0The next morning, the manna from heaven stopped coming. This happened the first day after the people ate the food that grew in the land of Canaan. From that time on, the Israelites did not get the manna from heaven.",
  "Joshua-5-13": "The Commander of the Lord\u2019s Army\u00a013\u00a0When Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him. The man had a sword in his hand. Joshua went to the man and asked, \u201cAre you a friend to our people or are you one of our enemies?\u201d",
  "Joshua-5-14": "14\u00a0The man answered, \u201cI am not an enemy. I am the commander of the Lord\u2019s army. I have just now come to you.\u201d\u00a0Then Joshua bowed his face to the ground to show respect and said, \u201cI am your servant. Does my master have a command for me?\u201d",
  "Joshua-5-15": "15\u00a0The commander of the Lord\u2019s army answered, \u201cTake off your sandals. The place where you are standing is holy.\u201d So Joshua obeyed him.",
  "Joshua-6-1": "6\u00a0The gates of the city of Jericho were closed. The people in the city were afraid because the Israelites were near. No one went into the city, and no one came out.",
  "Joshua-6-2": "2\u00a0Then the Lord said to Joshua, \u201cLook, I will let you defeat the city of Jericho. You will defeat the king and all the fighting men in the city.",
  "Joshua-6-3": "3\u00a0March around the city with your army once every day for six days.",
  "Joshua-6-4": "4\u00a0Tell seven of the priests to carry trumpets made from the horns of male sheep and to march in front of the priests who are carrying the Holy Box. On the seventh day march around the city seven times and tell the priests to blow the trumpets while they march.",
  "Joshua-6-5": "5\u00a0They will make one loud noise from the trumpets. When you hear that noise, tell all the people to begin shouting. When you do this, the walls of the city will fall down and your people will be able to go straight into the city.\u201d",
  "Joshua-6-6": "The Battle Against Jericho\u00a06\u00a0So Joshua son of Nun called the priests together and said to them, \u201cCarry the Holy Box of the Lord. Tell seven priests to carry the trumpets and march in front of it.\u201d",
  "Joshua-6-7": "7\u00a0Then Joshua ordered the people, \u201cNow go! March around the city. The soldiers with weapons will march in front of the Holy Box of the Lord.\u201d",
  "Joshua-6-8": "8\u00a0After Joshua finished speaking to the people, the seven priests with the trumpets began marching before the Lord, blowing the trumpets as they marched. The priests carrying the Lord\u2019s Holy Box followed them.",
  "Joshua-6-9": "9\u00a0The soldiers with weapons marched in front of the priests who were blowing the horns. And the rest of the men walked behind the Holy Box, marching and blowing their trumpets.",
  "Joshua-6-10": "10\u00a0Joshua had told the people not to give a war cry. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t shout. Don\u2019t say a word until the day I tell you. Then you will shout.\u201d",
  "Joshua-6-11": "11\u00a0So Joshua made the priests carry the Holy Box of the Lord around the city one time. Then they went back to the camp and spent the night there.",
  "Joshua-6-12": "12\u00a0Early the next morning Joshua got up, and the priests carried the Lord\u2019s Holy Box again.",
  "Joshua-6-13": "13\u00a0The seven priests with the trumpets marched in front of the Lord\u2019s Holy Box, blowing their trumpets. The soldiers with weapons marched in front of them. The rest of the people marched behind the Lord\u2019s Holy Box. During the whole time they marched, the priests were blowing the trumpets.",
  "Joshua-6-14": "14\u00a0On the second day, they all marched around the city one time. And then they went back to the camp. They continued to do this every day for six days.",
  "Joshua-6-15": "15\u00a0On the seventh day, they got up at dawn and marched around the city seven times. They marched in the same way they had marched on the days before, but on that day they marched around the city seven times.",
  "Joshua-6-16": "16\u00a0The seventh time they marched around the city, the priests blew their trumpets. Then Joshua gave the command: \u201cNow, shout! The Lord is giving you this city!",
  "Joshua-6-17": "17\u00a0The city and everything is to be destroyed as an offering to the Lord. Only Rahab the prostitute and everyone in her house will be left alive. These people must not be killed because she helped the two spies.",
  "Joshua-6-18": "18\u00a0Remember, we must destroy everything else. Don\u2019t take anything. If you take anything and bring it into our camp, you yourselves will be destroyed, and you will cause trouble for the rest of our people.",
  "Joshua-6-19": "19\u00a0All the things made from silver, gold, bronze, and iron belong to the Lord. They must be put in the Lord\u2019s treasury.\u201d",
  "Joshua-6-20": "20\u00a0So then the priests blew the trumpets. When the people heard the trumpets, they began shouting. The walls fell down, and the people ran up into the city. So the Israelites defeated that city.",
  "Joshua-6-21": "21\u00a0The people destroyed everything in the city. They destroyed everything that was living there. They killed the young and old men, the young and old women, and the cattle, sheep, and donkeys.",
  "Joshua-6-22": "22\u00a0Joshua talked to the two spies. He said, \u201cYou made a promise to the prostitute. So go to her house and bring her out and all those who are with her.\u201d",
  "Joshua-6-23": "23\u00a0So the two men went into the house and brought out Rahab, her father, mother, brothers, all her family, and all those who were with her. They put all the people in a safe place outside the camp of Israel.",
  "Joshua-6-24": "24\u00a0Then the Israelites burned the whole city and everything in it except for the things made from silver, gold, bronze, and iron. They put these things in the Lord\u2019s treasury.",
  "Joshua-6-25": "25\u00a0Joshua saved Rahab the prostitute, her family, and all those who were with her. Joshua let them live because Rahab helped the spies Joshua had sent out to Jericho. Rahab still lives among the Israelites today.",
  "Joshua-6-26": "26\u00a0At that time Joshua made this important promise. He said,\u00a0\u201cWhoever rebuilds Jericho\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0will be in danger from the Lord.\u00a0will be in danger from the Lord.\u00a0When he lays the foundation,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0he will lose his oldest son.\u00a0he will lose his oldest son.\u00a0When he sets up the gates,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0he will lose his youngest son.\u201d[a]\u00a0he will lose his youngest son.\u201d[a]",
  "Joshua-6-27": "27\u00a0So the Lord was with Joshua, and Joshua became famous throughout the whole country.",
  "Joshua-7-1": "Achan\u2019s Sin\u00a07\u00a0But the Israelites did not obey God. There was a man from the tribe of Judah named Achan son of Carmi, grandson of Zimri, great-grandson of Zerah. Achan kept some of the things that should have been destroyed. So the Lord became very angry with the Israelites.",
  "Joshua-7-2": "2\u00a0After they defeated Jericho, Joshua sent some men to Ai.[a] Ai was near Beth Aven, east of Bethel. He told them, \u201cGo to Ai and look for weaknesses in that area.\u201d So the men went to spy on that land.",
  "Joshua-7-3": "3\u00a0Later, the men came back to Joshua. They said, \u201cAi is a weak area. We will not need all of our people to defeat them. Send 2000 or 3000 men to fight there. There is no need to use the whole army. There are only a few men there to fight against us.\u201d",
  "Joshua-7-4-Josh-7-5": "4-5\u00a0So about 3000 men went to Ai, but the people of Ai killed about 36 men of Israel. And the Israelites ran away. The people of Ai chased them from the city gates all the way to the quarries.[b] The people of Ai beat them badly.\u00a0When the people from Israel saw this, they became very frightened and lost their courage.",
  "Joshua-7-6": "6\u00a0When Joshua heard about this, he tore his clothes to show his sadness. He bowed down to the ground before the Holy Box and stayed there until evening. The leaders of Israel did the same thing. They also threw dirt on their heads to show their sadness.",
  "Joshua-7-7": "7\u00a0Joshua said, \u201cLord God, you brought our people across the Jordan River. Why did you bring us this far and then allow the Amorites to destroy us? We should have been satisfied and stayed on the other side of the Jordan River.",
  "Joshua-7-8": "8\u00a0I promise by my life, Lord! There is nothing I can say now. Israel has surrendered to the enemy.",
  "Joshua-7-9": "9\u00a0The Canaanites and all the other people in this country will hear about what happened. Then they will attack us and kill all of us! Then what will you do to protect your great name?\u201d",
  "Joshua-7-10": "10\u00a0The Lord said to Joshua, \u201cWhy are you down there with your face on the ground? Stand up!",
  "Joshua-7-11": "11\u00a0The Israelites sinned against me. They have broken the agreement that I commanded them to obey. They took some of the things that I commanded them to destroy. They have stolen from me. They have lied. They have taken those things for themselves.",
  "Joshua-7-12": "12\u00a0That is why the army of Israel turned and ran away from the fight. They did that because they have done wrong. They should be destroyed. I will not continue to help you or be with you unless you destroy everything I commanded you to destroy.",
  "Joshua-7-13": "13\u00a0\u201cNow go and make the people pure. Tell them, \u2018Make yourselves pure. Prepare for tomorrow. The Lord, the God of Israel, says that some people are keeping things that he commanded to be destroyed. You will never be able to defeat your enemies until you throw away those things.",
  "Joshua-7-14": "14\u00a0\u201cTomorrow morning you must all stand before the Lord. All the tribes will stand before the Lord, and he will choose one tribe. Only that tribe will stand before him. Then the Lord will choose one family group from that tribe. Only that family group must stand before him. Then he will look at each family in that family group, and the Lord will choose one family. Then he will look at each man in that family.",
  "Joshua-7-15": "15\u00a0The man who is keeping those things that we should have destroyed will be caught. Then he will be destroyed by fire, and everything that he owns will be destroyed with him. He broke the agreement with the Lord. He has done a very bad thing to the Israelites!\u201d",
  "Joshua-7-16": "16\u00a0Early the next morning, Joshua led out all the Israelites. Each tribe came forward to stand before the Lord, and he chose the tribe of Judah.",
  "Joshua-7-17": "17\u00a0So then all the family groups of Judah stood before the Lord, and he chose the Zerah family group. Then all the families of the Zerah group stood before the Lord, and he chose the family of Zimri.",
  "Joshua-7-18": "18\u00a0Then Joshua told all the men in that family to come before the Lord. He chose Achan the son of Carmi. (Carmi was the son of Zimri. And Zimri was the son of Zerah.)",
  "Joshua-7-19": "19\u00a0Then Joshua said to Achan, \u201cSon, you must honor the Lord, the God of Israel. Praise him and confess your sins to him. Tell me what you did, and don\u2019t try to hide anything from me.\u201d",
  "Joshua-7-20": "20\u00a0Achan answered, \u201cIt is true! I sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel. This is what I did:",
  "Joshua-7-21": "21\u00a0In Jericho, I saw a beautiful coat from Babylonia,[c] about 5 pounds[d] of silver, and about a pound[e] of gold. I wanted these things for myself, so I took them. You will find them buried in the ground under my tent. The silver is under the coat.\u201d",
  "Joshua-7-22": "22\u00a0So Joshua sent some men to the tent. They ran to the tent and found the things hidden there. The silver was under the coat.",
  "Joshua-7-23": "23\u00a0The men brought the things out of the tent and took them to Joshua and all the Israelites. They threw them on the ground before the Lord.",
  "Joshua-7-24": "24\u00a0Then Joshua and all the people led Achan son of Zerah to the Valley of Achor. They also took the silver, the coat, the gold, Achan\u2019s sons and daughters, his cattle, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and everything he owned. They took all these things to the Valley of Achor with Achan.",
  "Joshua-7-25": "25\u00a0Then Joshua said, \u201cYou caused much trouble for us, but now the Lord will bring trouble to you.\u201d Then all the people threw stones at Achan and his family until they died. Then the people burned them and everything he owned.",
  "Joshua-7-26": "26\u00a0After they burned Achan, they put many rocks over his body. The rocks are still there today. That is why it is called the Valley of Achor.[f] After this the Lord was not angry with the people.",
  "Joshua-8-1": "Ai Destroyed\u00a08\u00a0Then the Lord said to Joshua, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid; don\u2019t give up. Lead all your fighting men to Ai.[a] I will help you defeat the king of Ai. I am giving you his people, his city, and his land.",
  "Joshua-8-2": "2\u00a0You will do to Ai and its king the same thing you did to Jericho and its king. Only this time you can take all the wealth and animals and keep it for yourselves. You will share the wealth with your people. Now, tell some of your soldiers to hide behind the city.\u201d",
  "Joshua-8-3": "3\u00a0So Joshua led his whole army toward Ai. Then Joshua chose 30,000 of his best fighting men and sent them out at night.",
  "Joshua-8-4": "4\u00a0Joshua gave them this command: \u201cListen carefully to what I tell you. You must hide in the area behind the city. Wait for the time to attack. Don\u2019t go far from the city. Continue to watch and be ready.",
  "Joshua-8-5": "5\u00a0I will lead the men with me; we will march toward the city. The men in the city will come out to fight against us. We will turn and run away from them as we did before.",
  "Joshua-8-6": "6\u00a0These men will chase us away from the city, so we will run away. They will think that we are running away from them as we did before.",
  "Joshua-8-7": "7\u00a0Then you should come out of your hiding place and take control of the city. The Lord your God will give you the power to win.",
  "Joshua-8-8": "8\u00a0\u201cYou must do what the Lord says. Watch me and I will give you the command to attack the city. When you have taken control of the city, burn it.\u201d",
  "Joshua-8-9": "9\u00a0Then Joshua sent them to their hiding place and waited. They went to a place west of Ai, between Bethel and Ai. But Joshua stayed the night with his people.",
  "Joshua-8-10": "10\u00a0Early the next morning Joshua gathered the men together. Then Joshua and the leaders of Israel led the men to Ai.",
  "Joshua-8-11": "11\u00a0All the soldiers who were with Joshua marched to Ai. They stopped in front of the city. The army made its camp north of the city. There was a valley between the army and Ai.",
  "Joshua-8-12": "12\u00a0Then Joshua chose about 5000 men. He sent these men to hide in the area west of the city, between Bethel and Ai.",
  "Joshua-8-13": "13\u00a0So Joshua had prepared his men for the fight. The main camp was north of the city. The other men were hiding to the west. That night Joshua went down into the valley.",
  "Joshua-8-14": "14\u00a0Later, the king of Ai saw the army of Israel. The king and his people hurried out to fight the army of Israel. The king of Ai went out the east side of the city toward the Jordan Valley, so he did not see the soldiers hiding behind the city.",
  "Joshua-8-15": "15\u00a0Joshua and all the men of Israel let the army of Ai push them back. Joshua and his men began running east toward the desert.",
  "Joshua-8-16": "16\u00a0The people in the city began to shout and started to chase them. All the people left the city.",
  "Joshua-8-17": "17\u00a0All the men of Ai and Bethel chased the army of Israel. The city was left open\u2014no one stayed to protect the city.",
  "Joshua-8-18": "18\u00a0Then the Lord said to Joshua, \u201cHold your spear toward the city of Ai, because I will give you that city.\u201d So Joshua held his spear toward the city of Ai.",
  "Joshua-8-19": "19\u00a0When the Israelites who were hiding saw this, they quickly came out from their hiding place and hurried toward the city. They entered the city and took control of it. Then the soldiers started fires to burn the city.",
  "Joshua-8-20": "20\u00a0The men from Ai looked back and saw their city burning. When they saw the smoke rising into the sky, they lost their strength and courage. They stopped chasing the men of Israel. The Israelites stopped running away. They turned and went to fight the men from Ai. There was no safe place for the men from Ai to run to.",
  "Joshua-8-21": "21\u00a0When Joshua and his men saw that his army had taken control of the city and that smoke was rising from it, they stopped running away and turned to fight the men of Ai.",
  "Joshua-8-22": "22\u00a0Then the men who were hiding came out of the city to help with the fight. The army of Israel was on both sides of the men of Ai\u2014the men of Ai were trapped. Israel defeated them. They fought until none of the men from Ai were left alive\u2014none of the enemy escaped.",
  "Joshua-8-23": "23\u00a0But the king of Ai was left alive. Joshua\u2019s men brought him to Joshua.",
  "Joshua-8-24": "A Review of the Fighting\u00a024\u00a0During the fighting, the army of Israel chased the men from Ai into the fields and into the desert. So the army of Israel finished killing all the men from Ai in the fields and in the desert. Then the Israelites went back to Ai and killed all the people who were still alive in the city.",
  "Joshua-8-25": "25\u00a0All the people of Ai died that day; there were 12,000 men and women.",
  "Joshua-8-26": "26\u00a0Joshua had held his spear toward Ai as a sign to his people to destroy the city. And he did not stop until all the people of Ai were destroyed.",
  "Joshua-8-27": "27\u00a0The Israelites kept the animals and other things from the city for themselves. This is what the Lord said they could do when he gave Joshua the commands.",
  "Joshua-8-28": "28\u00a0Then Joshua burned the city of Ai. That city became an empty pile of rocks. It is still like that today.",
  "Joshua-8-29": "29\u00a0Joshua hanged the king of Ai on a tree and left him hanging there until evening. At sunset Joshua told his men to take the king\u2019s body down from the tree. They threw his body down at the city gate. Then they covered the body with many rocks. That pile of rocks is still there today.",
  "Joshua-8-30": "Reading the Blessings and Curses\u00a030\u00a0Then Joshua built an altar for the Lord, the God of Israel. He built the altar on Mount Ebal.",
  "Joshua-8-31": "31\u00a0The Lord\u2019s servant Moses told the Israelites how to build altars. So Joshua built the altar the way it was explained in the Book of the Law[b] of Moses. The altar was made from stones that were not cut. No tool had ever been used on those stones. They offered burnt offerings to the Lord on that altar. They also gave fellowship offerings.",
  "Joshua-8-32": "32\u00a0There Joshua copied onto the stones the law Moses had written down. This was for all the people of Israel to see.",
  "Joshua-8-33": "33\u00a0The elders, officers, judges, and all the Israelites were standing around the Box of the Lord\u2019s Agreement. They were standing in front of the priests, the Levites who carried the Holy Box. The Israelites and the other people with them were all standing there. Half of the people stood in front of Mount Ebal and the other half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim. The Lord\u2019s servant Moses had told the people to do this. He told them to do this to be blessed.",
  "Joshua-8-34": "34\u00a0Then Joshua read all the words from the law. He read the blessings and the curses. He read everything the way it was written in the Book of the Law.",
  "Joshua-8-35": "35\u00a0All the Israelites were gathered together there. All the women and children and all the foreigners who lived with the Israelites were there. And Joshua read every command that Moses had given.",
  "Joshua-9-1": "The Gibeonites Trick Joshua\u00a09\u00a0All the kings west of the Jordan River heard about these things. They were the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. They lived in the hill country and in the plains. They also lived along the seacoast of the Mediterranean Sea as far as Lebanon.",
  "Joshua-9-2": "2\u00a0All these kings came together and made plans to fight against Joshua and the Israelites.",
  "Joshua-9-3": "3\u00a0The people from the city of Gibeon heard about the way Joshua had defeated Jericho and Ai.",
  "Joshua-9-4": "4\u00a0So they decided to try to trick the Israelites. This was their plan: They gathered together old wineskins that were cracked and broken. They put these old wineskins on the backs of their animals. They put old pieces of cloth on their animals to look as if they had traveled from far away.",
  "Joshua-9-5": "5\u00a0The men put old sandals on their feet and wore old clothes. They found some old bread that was dry and moldy.",
  "Joshua-9-6": "6\u00a0Then they went to the camp of the Israelites. This camp was near Gilgal.\u00a0The men went to Joshua and said to him, \u201cWe have traveled from a faraway country. We want to make a peace agreement with you.\u201d",
  "Joshua-9-7": "7\u00a0The men of Israel said to these Hivite men, \u201cMaybe you are trying to trick us. Maybe you live near us. We cannot make a peace agreement with you until we know where you are from.\u201d",
  "Joshua-9-8": "8\u00a0The Hivite men said to Joshua, \u201cWe are your servants.\u201d\u00a0But Joshua asked, \u201cWho are you? Where do you come from?\u201d",
  "Joshua-9-9": "9\u00a0The men answered, \u201cWe are your servants. We have come from a faraway country. We came because we heard of the great power of the Lord your God. We heard about what he has done and about everything he did in Egypt.",
  "Joshua-9-10": "10\u00a0And we heard that he defeated the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan River. This was King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan in the land of Ashtaroth.",
  "Joshua-9-11": "11\u00a0So our elders and our people said to us, \u2018Take enough food for your journey. Go and meet with the Israelites.\u2019 Tell them, \u2018We are your servants. Make a peace agreement with us.\u2019",
  "Joshua-9-12": "12\u00a0\u201cLook at our bread. When we left home, it was warm and fresh. But now you can see that it is dry and old.",
  "Joshua-9-13": "13\u00a0Look at our wineskins. When we left home, they were new and filled with wine. But now you can see that they are cracked and old. Look at our clothes and sandals. You can see that the long journey has almost destroyed the things we wear.\u201d",
  "Joshua-9-14": "14\u00a0The men of Israel wanted to know if these men were telling the truth. So they tasted the bread\u2014but they did not ask the Lord what they should do.",
  "Joshua-9-15": "15\u00a0Joshua agreed to make peace with them. He agreed to let them live. The leaders of Israel agreed with this promise of Joshua.",
  "Joshua-9-16": "16\u00a0Three days later the Israelites learned that these men lived very near their camp.",
  "Joshua-9-17": "17\u00a0So the Israelites went to the place where they lived. On the third day the Israelites came to the cities of Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim.",
  "Joshua-9-18": "18\u00a0But the army of Israel did not try to fight against those cities. They had made a peace agreement with them. They had made a promise to them before the Lord, the God of Israel.\u00a0All the people complained against the leaders who made the agreement.",
  "Joshua-9-19": "19\u00a0But the leaders answered, \u201cWe have given our promise. We promised before the Lord, the God of Israel. We cannot fight against them now.",
  "Joshua-9-20": "20\u00a0This is what we must do. We must let them live. We cannot hurt them or God will be angry with us because we broke the promise we made to them.",
  "Joshua-9-21": "21\u00a0So let them live, but they will be our servants. They will cut wood for us and carry water for all our people.\u201d So the leaders did not break their promise of peace to them.",
  "Joshua-9-22": "22\u00a0Joshua called the Gibeonites together. He said, \u201cWhy did you lie to us? Your land was near our camp. But you told us you were from a faraway country.",
  "Joshua-9-23": "23\u00a0Now, your people will have many troubles. All of your people will be slaves\u2014they will have to cut wood and carry water for the house of God.[a]\u201d",
  "Joshua-9-24": "24\u00a0The Gibeonites answered, \u201cWe lied to you because we were afraid you would kill us. We heard that God commanded his servant Moses to give you all this land. And God told you to kill all the people who lived in this land. That is why we lied to you.",
  "Joshua-9-25": "25\u00a0Now we are your servants. You can do whatever you think is right.\u201d",
  "Joshua-9-26": "26\u00a0So the Gibeonites became slaves, but Joshua let them live. He did not allow the Israelites to kill them.",
  "Joshua-9-27": "27\u00a0He made them slaves of the Israelites. They cut wood and carried water for the Israelites and for the altar of the Lord\u2014wherever the Lord chose it to be. They are still slaves today.",
  "Joshua-10-1": "The Day the Sun Stood Still\u00a010\u00a0At this time Adoni Zedek was the king of Jerusalem. He heard that Joshua had defeated Ai and completely destroyed it. The king learned that Joshua had done the same thing to Jericho and its king. He also learned that the Gibeonites had made a peace agreement with Israel and that they lived very near Jerusalem.",
  "Joshua-10-2": "2\u00a0So Adoni Zedek and his people were very frightened. Gibeon was not a small town like Ai. It was a very big city\u2014as big as any royal city.[a] And all the men in that city were good fighters, so the king was afraid.",
  "Joshua-10-3": "3\u00a0King Adoni Zedek of Jerusalem talked with King Hoham of Hebron. He also talked with King Piram of Jarmuth, King Japhia of Lachish, and King Debir of Eglon. The king of Jerusalem begged these men,",

  "Joshua-10-6": "6\u00a0The people in the city of Gibeon sent a message to Joshua at his camp at Gilgal: \u201cWe are your servants! Don\u2019t leave us alone. Come and help us! Hurry! Save us! All the Amorite kings from the hill country have brought their armies together to fight against us.\u201d",

  "Joshua-10-8": "8\u00a0The Lord said to Joshua, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of those armies. I will allow you to defeat them. None of them will be able to defeat you.\u201d",
  "Joshua-10-9": "9\u00a0Joshua and his army marched all night to Gibeon, so it was a complete surprise when he attacked them.",
  "Joshua-10-10": "10\u00a0The Lord caused those armies to be very confused when Israel attacked. So Israel defeated them and won a great victory. Israel chased the enemy from Gibeon along the road going up to Beth Horon. The army of Israel killed men all the way to Azekah and Makkedah.",
  "Joshua-10-11": "11\u00a0Then they chased the enemy down the road from Beth Horon to Azekah. While they were chasing the enemy, the Lord caused large hailstones to fall from the sky. Many of the enemy were killed by these large hailstones. More men were killed by the hailstones than by the swords of the soldiers of Israel.",
  "Joshua-10-12": "12\u00a0On that day the Lord gave Israel the victory against the Amorites. Joshua stood before all the Israelites and said to the Lord:\u00a0\u201cSun, stop over Gibeon.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moon, stand still over the Valley of Aijalon.\u201d\u00a0Moon, stand still over the Valley of Aijalon.\u201d",
  "Joshua-10-13": "13\u00a0So the sun did not move, and the moon stopped until the people defeated their enemies. This story is written in the Book of Jashar. The sun stopped in the middle of the sky. It did not move for a full day.",
  "Joshua-10-14": "14\u00a0That had never happened before, and it has never happened again. That was the day the Lord obeyed a man. The Lord really was fighting for Israel!",
  "Joshua-10-15": "15\u00a0After this, Joshua and his army went back to the camp at Gilgal.",
  "Joshua-10-16": "16\u00a0But during the fight, the five kings ran away. They hid in a cave near Makkedah,",
  "Joshua-10-17": "17\u00a0but someone found them hiding in that cave. Joshua learned about this.",
  "Joshua-10-18": "18\u00a0He said, \u201cCover the entrance to the cave with large rocks. Put some men there to guard the cave.",
  "Joshua-10-19": "19\u00a0But don\u2019t stay there yourselves. Continue chasing the enemy and attacking them from behind. Don\u2019t let the enemy get back to their cities. The Lord your God has given you the victory over them.\u201d",
  "Joshua-10-20": "20\u00a0So Joshua and the Israelites killed the enemy. But some of them were able to go to their cities that had tall walls around them and hide. These men were not killed.",
  "Joshua-10-21": "21\u00a0After the fighting, Joshua\u2019s men came back to him at Makkedah. Not one of the people in that country was brave enough to say anything against the Israelites.",

  "Joshua-10-23": "23\u00a0So Joshua\u2019s men brought the five kings out of the cave\u2014the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon.",
  "Joshua-10-24": "24\u00a0When they brought the five kings to Joshua, he called all his men to come to that place. He said to the officers of his army, \u201cCome here! Put your feet on the necks of these kings.\u201d So the officers of Joshua\u2019s army came close and put their feet on the necks of the kings.",
  "Joshua-10-25": "25\u00a0Then Joshua said to his men, \u201cBe strong and brave! Don\u2019t be afraid. I will show you what the Lord will do to all the enemies you will fight in the future.\u201d",
  "Joshua-10-26": "26\u00a0Then Joshua killed the five kings and hanged their bodies on five trees. He left them hanging in the trees until evening.",
  "Joshua-10-27": "27\u00a0At sunset Joshua told his men to take the bodies down from the trees. So they threw the bodies into the cave where the kings had been hiding and covered the entrance of the cave with large rocks. Their bodies are still in that cave today.",
  "Joshua-10-28": "28\u00a0That day Joshua defeated Makkedah. He killed the king and the people in that city. No one was left alive. Joshua did the same thing to the king of Makkedah that he had done to the king of Jericho.",

  "Joshua-10-40": "40\u00a0So Joshua defeated all the kings of the cities of the hill country, the Negev, the western foothills, and the eastern foothills. The Lord, the God of Israel, had told Joshua to kill all the people, so Joshua did not leave anyone alive in those places.",

  "Joshua-24-8": "8\u00a0Then I brought you to the land of the Amorites, east of the Jordan River. Those people fought against you, but I allowed you to defeat them. I gave you the power to destroy them, and you took control of that land.",
