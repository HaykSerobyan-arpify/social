  "Jeremiah-32-2": "2\u00a0At that time the army of the king of Babylon was surrounding the city of Jerusalem, and Jeremiah was under arrest in the courtyard of the guard. This courtyard was at the palace of the king of Judah.",
  "Jeremiah-32-3": "3\u00a0King Zedekiah of Judah had put Jeremiah in prison in that place. Zedekiah didn\u2019t like the things Jeremiah prophesied.

Buy that land for yourself because it is your right to buy it and own it.\u2019\u201d\u00a0So I knew that this was a message from the Lord.",

The Babylonian army will burn down those houses.",
  "Jeremiah-32-30": "30\u00a0I have watched the people of Israel and the people of Judah. Everything they do is evil. They have done evil things since they were young.

  "Jeremiah-32-32": "32\u00a0I will destroy Jerusalem because of all the evil things the people of Israel and Judah have done. The people, their kings, leaders, their priests and prophets, the people of Judah, and the people of Jerusalem have all made me angry.",
  "Jeremiah-32-33": "33\u00a0\u201cThey should have come to me for help, but they turned their backs to me. I tried to teach them again and again, but they would not listen to me. I tried to correct them, but they would not listen.",
  "Jeremiah-32-34": "34\u00a0They have made their idols, and I hate those idols. They put their idols in the Temple that is called by my name, so they made my Temple \u2018dirty.\u2019",

I never even thought the people of Judah would do such a terrible thing.",
  "Jeremiah-32-36": "36\u00a0\u201cYou people are saying, \u2018The king of Babylon will capture Jerusalem. He will use war, hunger, and disease to defeat this city.\u2019 But this is what the Lord, the God of the people of Israel, says:",
  "Jeremiah-32-37": "37\u00a0\u2018I have forced the people of Israel and Judah to leave their land. I was very angry with them, but I will bring them back to this place.

  "Jeremiah-36-15": "15\u00a0Then the officials said to Baruch, \u201cSit down and read the scroll to us.\u201d\u00a0So Baruch read the scroll to them.",
  "Jeremiah-36-16": "16\u00a0When the royal officials heard all the messages from the scroll, they were afraid and looked at one another. They said to Baruch, \u201cWe must tell King Jehoiakim about these messages on the scroll.\u201d",
  "Jeremiah-36-17": "17\u00a0Then the officials asked Baruch, \u201cTell us, Baruch, where did you get these messages that you wrote on the scroll? Did you write down what Jeremiah said to you?\u201d",

  "Jeremiah-36-21": "21\u00a0So King Jehoiakim sent Jehudi to get the scroll. Jehudi brought the scroll from the room of Elishama the scribe. Then Jehudi read the scroll to the king and all the servants who stood around the king.",
  "Jeremiah-36-22": "22\u00a0The time this happened was in the ninth month,[b] so King Jehoiakim was sitting in the part of the palace used for winter. There was a fire burning in a small fireplace in front of the king.",
  "Jeremiah-36-23": "23\u00a0Jehudi began to read from the scroll. But after he would read two or three columns, King Jehoiakim would grab the scroll.

  "Jeremiah-36-25": "25\u00a0Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah tried to talk King Jehoiakim out of burning the scroll, but he would not listen to them.",
  "Jeremiah-36-26": "26\u00a0Instead King Jehoiakim commanded some men to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. These men were Jerahmeel, a son of the king, Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel. But they could not find Baruch and Jeremiah, because the Lord had hidden them.",
  "Jeremiah-36-27": "27\u00a0King Jehoiakim burned the scroll on which Baruch had written all the words that Jeremiah had spoken to him. Then this message from the Lord came to Jeremiah:",

  "Jeremiah-36-29": "29\u00a0Also tell King Jehoiakim of Judah that this is what the Lord says: \u2018Jehoiakim, you burned that scroll. You said, \u201cWhy did Jeremiah write that the king of Babylon will surely come and destroy this land and kill all the people and animals in it?\u201d",
  "Jeremiah-36-30": "30\u00a0So this is what the Lord says about King Jehoiakim of Judah: Jehoiakim\u2019s descendants will not sit on David\u2019s throne.

  "Jeremiah-36-31": "31\u00a0I will punish Jehoiakim and his children, and I will punish his officials. I will do this because they are wicked. I will bring terrible disasters on them and on all those who live in Jerusalem and on the people from Judah. I will bring all these bad things on them, just as I warned them, because they have not listened to me.\u2019\u201d",
  "Jeremiah-36-32": "32\u00a0Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch son of Neriah, the scribe.
