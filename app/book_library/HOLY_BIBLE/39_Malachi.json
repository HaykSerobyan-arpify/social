  "Malachi-1-1": "1\u00a0This is a message from the Lord to Israel. God used Malachi to tell this message to the people.",
  "Malachi-1-2": "God Loves Israel\u00a02\u00a0The Lord said, \u201cI love you people.\u201d\u00a0But you said, \u201cWhat shows you love us?\u201d\u00a0The Lord said, \u201cEsau was Jacob\u2019s brother, but I chose[a] Jacob.",
  "Malachi-1-3": "3\u00a0And I did not accept[b] Esau. I destroyed his hill country.[c] His country was destroyed, and now only wild dogs[d] live there.\u201d",
  "Malachi-1-4": "4\u00a0The people of Edom might say, \u201cWe were destroyed, but we will go back and rebuild our cities.\u201d\u00a0But the Lord All-Powerful says, \u201cIf they rebuild their cities, I will destroy them again.\u201d That is why people say Edom is an evil country\u2014a nation the Lord hates forever.",
  "Malachi-1-5": "5\u00a0You people saw these things, and you said, \u201cThe Lord is great, even outside of Israel!\u201d",
  "Malachi-1-6": "The People Don\u2019t Respect God\u00a06\u00a0The Lord All-Powerful said, \u201cChildren honor their fathers. Servants honor their masters. I am your Father, so why don\u2019t you honor me? I am your master, so why don\u2019t you respect me? You priests don\u2019t respect my name.\u00a0\u201cBut you say, \u2018What have we done that shows we don\u2019t respect your name?\u2019",
  "Malachi-1-7": "7\u00a0\u201cYou bring unclean bread to my altar.\u00a0\u201cBut you ask, \u2018What makes that bread unclean?\u2019\u00a0\u201cIt is unclean because you show no respect for the altar of the Lord.",
  "Malachi-1-8": "8\u00a0You bring blind animals as sacrifices, and that is wrong. You bring sick and crippled animals for sacrifices, and that is wrong. Try giving those sick animals as a gift to your governor. Would he accept those sick animals? No, he would not accept them.\u201d This is what the Lord All-Powerful said.",
  "Malachi-1-9": "9\u00a0\u201cNow try asking God to be good to you. But he will not listen to you, and it is all your fault.\u201d This is what the Lord All-Powerful said.",
  "Malachi-1-10": "10\u00a0\u201cI wish one of you would close the Temple doors to stop the lighting of useless fires on my altar. I am not pleased with you. I will not accept your gifts.\u201d This is what the Lord All-Powerful said.",
  "Malachi-1-11": "11\u00a0\u201cPeople all around the world respect my name. All around the world they bring good gifts to me and burn good incense as a gift to me, because my name is important to all of them.\u201d This is what the Lord All-Powerful said.",
  "Malachi-1-12": "12\u00a0\u201cBut you people show that you don\u2019t respect my name. You say that the Lord\u2019s altar is unclean. And you don\u2019t like the food from that altar.",
  "Malachi-1-13": "13\u00a0You smell the food and refuse to eat it. You say it is bad. Then you bring sick, crippled, and hurt animals to me. You try to give sick animals to me as sacrifices, but I will not accept them.\u201d This is what the Lord All-Powerful said.",
  "Malachi-1-14": "14\u00a0\u201cSome people have good, male animals that they could give as sacrifices, but don\u2019t. Some people bring good animals and promise to give those healthy animals to me. But then they secretly exchange those good animals and give me sick animals instead. Bad things will happen to those people. I am the Great King and people all around the world respect me!\u201d This is what the Lord All-Powerful said.",
  "Malachi-2-1": "Rules for Priests\u00a02\u00a0\u201cPriests, this rule is for you.",
  "Malachi-2-2": "2\u00a0Listen to me! Pay attention to what I say. Show honor to my name. If you don\u2019t respect my name, bad things will happen to you. You will say blessings,[a] but they will become curses. I will make bad things happen because you don\u2019t show respect for my name.\u201d This is what the Lord All-Powerful said.",
  "Malachi-2-3": "3\u00a0\u201cLook, I will punish your descendants. During the festivals, you priests offer sacrifices to me. You take the dung and inside parts from the dead animals and throw them away. But I will smear the dung on your faces, and you will be thrown away with it!",
  "Malachi-2-4": "4\u00a0Then you will learn why I am giving you this command. I am telling you these things so that my agreement with Levi will continue.\u201d This is what the Lord All-Powerful said.",
  "Malachi-2-5": "5\u00a0The Lord said, \u201cI made that agreement with Levi. I promised to give him life and peace\u2014and I gave him those things. Levi respected me and showed honor to my name.",
  "Malachi-2-6": "6\u00a0He taught the true teachings and didn\u2019t teach lies. Levi was honest, and he loved peace. He followed me and saved many people from being punished for the evil things they did.",
  "Malachi-2-7": "7\u00a0A priest should know God\u2019s teachings. People should be able to go to a priest and learn God\u2019s teachings. A priest should be the Lord\u2019s messenger to the people.",
  "Malachi-2-8": "8\u00a0\u201cBut you priests stopped following me! You used the teachings to make people do wrong. You ruined the agreement with Levi.\u201d This is what the Lord All-Powerful said.",
  "Malachi-2-9": "9\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t live the way I told you. You have not accepted my teachings. So I will cause people to hate you and think you are worth nothing.\u201d",
  "Malachi-2-10": "Judah Was Not True to God\u00a010\u00a0We all have the same father. The same God made every one of us. So why do people cheat one another? They show that they don\u2019t respect the agreement. They don\u2019t respect the agreement that our ancestors made with God.",
  "Malachi-2-11": "11\u00a0The people of Judah cheated other people. People in Jerusalem and Israel did terrible things. God loves the Temple, but the people in Judah didn\u2019t respect the Lord\u2019s holy Temple. The people of Judah began to worship a foreign goddess.",
  "Malachi-2-12": "12\u00a0The Lord will remove them from Judah\u2019s family. They might bring gifts to the Lord All-Powerful\u2014but it will not help.",
  "Malachi-2-13": "13\u00a0You can cry and cover the Lord\u2019s altar with tears, but the Lord will not accept your gifts. He will not be pleased with the things you bring to him.",
  "Malachi-2-14": "14\u00a0You ask, \u201cWhy are our gifts not accepted?\u201d It is because the Lord saw the evil things you did\u2014he is a witness against you. He saw you cheat on your wife. You have been married to her since you were young. She was your girlfriend. Then you made your vows to each other\u2014and she became your wife.",
  "Malachi-2-15": "15\u00a0God wants husbands and wives to become one body and one spirit. Why? So that they would have holy children and protect that spiritual unity. Don\u2019t cheat on your wife. She has been your wife from the time you were young.",
  "Malachi-2-16": "16\u00a0The Lord, the God of Israel, says, \u201cI hate divorce, and I hate the cruel things that men do. So protect your spiritual unity. Don\u2019t cheat on your wife.\u201d",
  "Malachi-2-17": "The Special Time of Judgment\u00a017\u00a0You have taught wrong things, and it makes the Lord very sad. People were doing evil things, but you said that this pleased the Lord and that he accepted those things. And you taught that God does not punish people for the evil they do.",
  "Malachi-3-1": "3\u00a0The Lord All-Powerful says, \u201cI am sending my messenger to prepare the way for me. Then suddenly, the Lord you are looking for will come to his temple.[a] Yes, the messenger you are waiting for, the one who will tell about my agreement, is really coming!",
  "Malachi-3-2": "2\u00a0\u201cNo one can prepare for that time or stand against him when he comes. He will be like a burning fire. He will be like the strong soap people use to make things clean.",
  "Malachi-3-3": "3\u00a0He will make the Levites clean. He will make them pure, like silver is made pure with fire! He will make them pure like gold and silver. Then they will bring gifts to the Lord, and they will do things the right way.",
  "Malachi-3-4": "4\u00a0Then the Lord will accept the gifts from Judah and Jerusalem. It will be as it was in the past\u2014as the time long ago.",
  "Malachi-3-5": "5\u00a0Then I will bring you to justice. I will be an expert witness and testify about the evil things people do. I will speak out against those who do evil magic or commit adultery. I will speak out against those who make false promises and cheat their workers and don\u2019t pay them the money they promised. I will testify against those who don\u2019t help strangers, or widows and orphans. And I will testify against those who don\u2019t respect me.\u201d This is what the Lord All-Powerful said.",
  "Malachi-3-6": "Stealing From God\u00a06\u00a0\u201cI am the Lord, and I don\u2019t change. You are Jacob\u2019s children, and you have not been completely destroyed.",
  "Malachi-3-7": "7\u00a0But you never obeyed my laws. Even your ancestors stopped following me. Come back to me, and I will come back to you.\u201d This is what the Lord All-Powerful said.\u00a0\u201cYou say, \u2018How can we come back?\u2019",
  "Malachi-3-8": "8\u00a0\u201cPeople should not steal things from God, but you stole things from me.\u00a0\u201cYou say, \u2018What did we steal from you?\u2019\u00a0\u201cYou should have given me one-tenth of your things. You should have given me special gifts.",
  "Malachi-3-9": "9\u00a0In this way your whole nation has stolen things from me, so bad things are happening to you.\u201d",
  "Malachi-3-10": "10\u00a0The Lord All-Powerful says, \u201cTry this test. Bring one-tenth of your things to me. Put them in the treasury. Bring food to my house. Test me! If you do these things, I will surely bless you. Good things will come to you like rain falling from the sky. You will have more than enough of everything.",
  "Malachi-3-11": "11\u00a0I will not let pests destroy your crops. All your grapevines will produce grapes.\u201d This is what the Lord All-Powerful said.",
  "Malachi-3-12": "12\u00a0\u201cPeople from other nations will be good to you. You will have a wonderful country.\u201d This is what the Lord All-Powerful said.",
  "Malachi-3-13": "The Special Time of Judgment\u00a013\u00a0The Lord says, \u201cYou said cruel things to me.\u201d\u00a0But you ask, \u201cWhat did we say about you?\u201d",
  "Malachi-3-14": "14\u00a0You said, \u201cIt is useless to worship God. We did what the Lord All-Powerful told us, but we didn\u2019t gain anything. We cried like people at a funeral to show we were sorry for our sins, but it didn\u2019t help.",
  "Malachi-3-15": "15\u00a0We think proud people are happy. Evil people succeed. They do evil things to test God\u2019s patience, and God does not punish them.\u201d",
  "Malachi-3-16": "16\u00a0Then the Lord\u2019s followers spoke with each other, and the Lord listened to them. There is a book in front of him. In that book are the names of his followers. They are the people who honor the Lord\u2019s name.",
  "Malachi-3-17": "17\u00a0The Lord said, \u201cThey belong to me. I will be kind to them. Parents are very kind to their children who obey them. In the same way I will be kind to my followers.",
  "Malachi-3-18": "18\u00a0You people will come back to me, and you will learn the difference between good and evil. You will learn the difference between someone who follows God and someone who does not.",
  "Malachi-4-1": "4\u00a0\u201cThat time of judgment is coming. It will be like a hot furnace. All the proud people will be punished. All the evil people will burn like straw. At that time they will be like a bush burning in the fire, and there will not be a branch or root left.\u201d This is what the Lord All-Powerful said.",
  "Malachi-4-2": "2\u00a0\u201cBut, for my followers, goodness will shine on you like the rising sun. And it will bring healing power like the sun\u2019s rays. You will be free and happy, like calves freed from their stalls.[a]",
  "Malachi-4-3": "3\u00a0Then you will walk on the evil people\u2014they will be like ashes under your feet. I will make this happen at the time of judgment.\u201d This is what the Lord All-Powerful said.",
  "Malachi-4-4": "4\u00a0\u201cRemember and obey the law of my servant Moses. I gave those laws and rules to him at Mount Horeb. They are for all the people of Israel.",
  "Malachi-4-5": "5\u00a0\u201cLook, I will send Elijah the prophet to you. He will come before that great and terrible time of judgment from the Lord.",
  "Malachi-4-6": "6\u00a0Elijah will help the parents become close to their children, and he will help the children become close to their parents. This must happen, or I will come and completely destroy your country.\u201d"
