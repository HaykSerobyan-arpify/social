  "Hebrews-6-18": "18\u00a0These two things cannot change: God cannot lie when he says something, and he cannot lie when he makes an oath.\u00a0So these two things are a great help to us who have come to God for safety. They encourage us to hold on to the hope that is ours.",

  "Hebrews-7-2": "2\u00a0Then Abraham gave him a tenth of everything he had.\u00a0The name Melchizedek, king of Salem, has two meanings. First, Melchizedek means \u201cking of justice.\u201d And \u201cking of Salem\u201d means \u201cking of peace.\u201d",
  "Hebrews-7-3": "3\u00a0No one knows who his father or mother was or where he came from.[a] And no one knows when he was born or when he died. Melchizedek is like the Son of God in that he will always be a priest.",
  "Hebrews-7-4": "4\u00a0You can see that Melchizedek was very great. Abraham, our great ancestor, gave him a tenth of everything he won in battle.",
  "Hebrews-7-5": "5\u00a0Now the law says that those from the tribe of Levi who become priests must get a tenth from their own people, even though they and their people are both from the family of Abraham.",

  "Hebrews-7-9": "9\u00a0Now those from the family of Levi are the ones who get a tenth from the people. But we can say that when Abraham paid Melchizedek a tenth, then Levi also paid it.",
  "Hebrews-7-10": "10\u00a0Levi was not yet born, but he already existed in his ancestor Abraham when Melchizedek met him.",
  "Hebrews-7-11": "11\u00a0The people were given the law under the system of priests from the tribe of Levi. But no one could be made spiritually perfect through that system of priests. So there was a need for another priest to come. I mean a priest like Melchizedek, not Aaron.",
  "Hebrews-7-12": "12\u00a0And when a different kind of priest comes, then the law must be changed too.",
  "Hebrews-7-13-Heb-7-14": "13-14\u00a0We are talking about our Lord Christ, who belonged to a different tribe. No one from that tribe ever served as a priest at the altar. It is clear that Christ came from the tribe of Judah. And Moses said nothing about priests belonging to that tribe.",
  "Hebrews-7-15": "Jesus Is a Priest Like Melchizedek\u00a015\u00a0And these things become even clearer when we see that another priest has come who is like Melchizedek.",
  "Hebrews-7-16": "16\u00a0He was made a priest, but not because he met the requirement of being born into the right family. He became a priest by the power of a life that will never end.",
  "Hebrews-7-17": "17\u00a0This is what the Scriptures say about him: \u201cYou are a priest forever\u2014the kind of priest Melchizedek was.\u201d[b]",

  "Hebrews-7-19": "19\u00a0The Law of Moses could not make anything perfect. But now a better hope has been given to us. And with that hope we can come near to God.",
  "Hebrews-7-20": "20\u00a0Also, it is important that God made a promise with an oath when he made Jesus high priest. When those other men became priests, there was no oath.",
  "Hebrews-7-21": "21\u00a0But Christ became a priest with God\u2019s oath. God said to him,\u00a0\u201cThe Lord has made a promise with an oath\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and will not change his mind:\u00a0and will not change his mind:\u00a0\u2018You are a priest forever.\u2019\u201d (A)",
  "Hebrews-7-22": "22\u00a0So this means that Jesus is the guarantee of a better agreement from God to his people.",
  "Hebrews-7-23": "23\u00a0Also, when one of those other priests died, he could not continue being a priest. So there were many of those priests.",
  "Hebrews-7-24": "24\u00a0But Jesus lives forever. He will never stop serving as a priest.",
  "Hebrews-7-25": "25\u00a0So Christ can save those who come to God through him. Christ can do this forever, because he always lives and is ready to help people when they come before God.",
  "Hebrews-7-26": "26\u00a0So Jesus is the kind of high priest we need. He is holy. He has no sin in him. He is pure and not influenced by sinners. And he is raised above the heavens.",
  "Hebrews-7-27": "27\u00a0He is not like those other priests. They had to offer sacrifices every day, first for their own sins, and then for the sins of the people. But Jesus doesn\u2019t need to do that. He offered only one sacrifice for all time. He offered himself.",
  "Hebrews-7-28": "28\u00a0The law chooses high priests who are men and have the same weaknesses that all people have. But after the law, God spoke the oath that made his Son high priest. And that Son, made perfect through suffering, will serve forever.",
  "Hebrews-8-1": "Jesus Our High Priest\u00a08\u00a0Here is the point of what we are saying: We have a high priest like that, who sits on the right side[a] of God\u2019s throne in heaven.",
  "Hebrews-8-2": "2\u00a0Our high priest serves in the Most Holy Place.[b] He serves in the true place of worship[c] that was made by God, not by anyone here on earth.",
  "Hebrews-8-3": "3\u00a0Every high priest has the work of offering gifts and sacrifices to God. So our high priest must also offer something to God.",
  "Hebrews-8-4": "4\u00a0If our high priest were now living on earth, he would not be a priest. I say this because there are already priests here who follow the law by offering gifts to God.",
  "Hebrews-8-5": "5\u00a0The work that these priests do is really only a copy and a shadow of what is in heaven. That is why God warned Moses when he was ready to build the Holy Tent: \u201cBe sure to make everything exactly like the pattern I showed you on the mountain.\u201d[d]",
  "Hebrews-8-6": "6\u00a0But the work that has been given to Jesus is much greater than the work that was given to those priests. In the same way, the new agreement that Jesus brought from God to his people is much greater than the old one. And the new agreement is based on better promises.",

  "Hebrews-9-1": "Worship Under the Old Agreement\u00a09\u00a0The first agreement had rules for worship and a place for worship here on earth.",
  "Hebrews-9-2": "2\u00a0This place was inside a tent. The first area in the tent was called the Holy Place. In the Holy Place were the lamp and the table with the special bread offered to God.",
  "Hebrews-9-3": "3\u00a0Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place.",
  "Hebrews-9-4": "4\u00a0In the Most Holy Place was a golden altar for burning incense. And also there was the Box of the Agreement. The Box was covered with gold. Inside this Box was a golden jar of manna and Aaron\u2019s rod\u2014the rod that once grew leaves. Also in the Box were the flat stones with the Ten Commandments of the old agreement on them.",
  "Hebrews-9-5": "5\u00a0Above the Box were the Cherub angels that showed God\u2019s glory. These Cherub angels were over the place of mercy.[a] But we cannot say everything about this now.",
  "Hebrews-9-6": "6\u00a0Everything in the tent was made ready in the way I have explained. Then the priests went into the first room every day to do their worship duties.",
  "Hebrews-9-7": "7\u00a0But only the high priest could go into the second room, and he went in only once a year. Also, he could never enter that room without taking blood with him. He offered that blood to God for himself and for the sins the people committed without knowing they were sinning.",
  "Hebrews-9-8": "8\u00a0The Holy Spirit uses those two separate rooms to teach us that the way into the Most Holy Place[b] was not open while the first room was still there.",
  "Hebrews-9-9": "9\u00a0This is an example for us today. It shows that the gifts and sacrifices the priests offer to God are not able to make the consciences of the worshipers completely clear.",
  "Hebrews-9-10": "10\u00a0These gifts and sacrifices are only about food and drink and special washings. They are only rules about the body. God gave them for his people to follow until the time of his new way.",
  "Hebrews-9-11": "Worship Under the New Agreement\u00a011\u00a0But Christ has already come to be the high priest. He is the high priest of the good things we now have. But Christ does not serve in a place like the tent that those other priests served in. He serves in a better place. Unlike that tent, this one is perfect. It was not made by anyone here on earth. It does not belong to this world.",
  "Hebrews-9-12": "12\u00a0Christ entered the Most Holy Place only one time\u2014enough for all time. He entered the Most Holy Place by using his own blood, not the blood of goats or young bulls. He entered there and made us free from sin forever.",
  "Hebrews-9-13": "13\u00a0The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a cow were sprinkled on those who were no longer pure enough to enter the place of worship. The blood and ashes made them pure again\u2014but only their bodies.",
  "Hebrews-9-14": "14\u00a0So surely the blood sacrifice of Christ can do much more. Christ offered himself through the eternal Spirit[c] as a perfect sacrifice to God. His blood will make us completely clean from the evil we have done. It will give us clear consciences so that we can worship the living God.",
  "Hebrews-9-15": "15\u00a0So Christ brings a new agreement from God to his people. He brings this agreement so that those who are chosen by God can have the blessings God promised, blessings that last forever. This can happen only because Christ died to free people from sins committed against the commands of the first agreement.",
  "Hebrews-9-16": "16\u00a0When someone dies and leaves a will, there must be proof that the one who wrote the will is dead.",
  "Hebrews-9-17": "17\u00a0A will means nothing while the one who wrote it is still living. It can be used only after that person\u2019s death.",
  "Hebrews-9-18": "18\u00a0That is why blood was needed to begin the first agreement between God and his people.",
  "Hebrews-9-19": "19\u00a0First, Moses told the people every command in the law. Then he took the blood of young bulls and mixed it with water. He used red wool and a branch of hyssop to sprinkle the blood and water on the book of the law and on all the people.",
  "Hebrews-9-20": "20\u00a0Then he said, \u201cThis is the blood that makes the agreement good\u2014the agreement that God commanded you to follow.\u201d[d]",
  "Hebrews-9-21": "21\u00a0In the same way, Moses sprinkled the blood on the Holy Tent. He sprinkled the blood over everything used in worship.",
  "Hebrews-9-22": "22\u00a0The law says that almost everything must be made clean by blood. Sins cannot be forgiven without a blood sacrifice.",
  "Hebrews-9-23": "Jesus Christ Is Our Sacrifice for Sin\u00a023\u00a0These things are copies of the real things that are in heaven. These copies had to be made clean by animal sacrifices. But the real things in heaven must have much better sacrifices.",
  "Hebrews-9-24": "24\u00a0Christ went into the Most Holy Place. But it was not the man-made one, which is only a copy of the real one. He went into heaven, and he is there now before God to help us.",
  "Hebrews-9-25": "25\u00a0The high priest enters the Most Holy Place once every year. He takes with him blood to offer. But he does not offer his own blood like Christ did. Christ went into heaven, but not to offer himself many times like the high priest offers blood again and again.",
  "Hebrews-9-26": "26\u00a0If Christ had offered himself many times, he would have needed to suffer many times since the time the world was made. But he came to offer himself only once. And that once is enough for all time. He came at a time when the world is nearing an end. He came to take away all sin by offering himself as a sacrifice.",
  "Hebrews-9-27": "27\u00a0Everyone must die once. Then they are judged.",
  "Hebrews-9-28": "28\u00a0So Christ was offered as a sacrifice one time to take away the sins of many people. And he will come a second time, but not to offer himself for sin. He will come the second time to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.",
  "Hebrews-10-1": "Jesus Christ\u2014the Only Sacrifice We Need\u00a010\u00a0The law gave us only an unclear picture of the good things coming in the future. The law is not a perfect picture of the real things. The law tells people to offer the same sacrifices every year. Those who come to worship God continue to offer those sacrifices. But the law can never make them perfect.",
  "Hebrews-10-2": "2\u00a0If the law could make people perfect, those sacrifices would have already stopped. They would already be clean from their sins, and they would not still feel guilty.",
  "Hebrews-10-3": "3\u00a0But that\u2019s not what happens. Their sacrifices make them remember their sins every year,",
  "Hebrews-10-4": "4\u00a0because it is not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.",
  "Hebrews-10-5": "5\u00a0So when Christ came into the world he said,\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t want sacrifices and offerings,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0but you have prepared a body for me.\u00a0but you have prepared a body for me.",

  "Hebrews-10-9": "9\u00a0Then he said, \u201cHere I am, God. I have come to do what you want.\u201d So God ends that first system of sacrifices and starts his new way.",
