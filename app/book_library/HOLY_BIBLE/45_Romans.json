  "Romans-1-3-Rom-1-4": "3-4\u00a0The Good News is about God\u2019s Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. As a human, he was born from the family of David, but through the Holy Spirit[a] he was shown to be God\u2019s powerful Son when he was raised from death.",
  "Romans-1-5": "5\u00a0Through Christ, God gave me the special work of an apostle\u2014to lead people of all nations to believe and obey him. I do all this to honor Christ.",

  "Romans-1-8": "A Prayer of Thanks\u00a08\u00a0First I want to say that I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you. I thank him because people everywhere in the world are talking about your great faith.",
  "Romans-1-9-Rom-1-10": "9-10\u00a0Every time I pray, I always remember you. God knows this is true. He is the one I serve with all my heart by telling people the Good News about his Son. I pray that I will be allowed to come to you. It will happen if God wants it.",
  "Romans-1-11": "11\u00a0I want very much to see you and give you some spiritual gift to make your faith stronger.",
  "Romans-1-12": "12\u00a0I mean that I want us to help each other with the faith that we have. Your faith will help me, and my faith will help you.",
  "Romans-1-13": "13\u00a0Brothers and sisters, I want you to know that I have planned many times to come to you, but something always happens to change my plans. I would like to see the same good result among you that I have had from my work among the other non-Jewish people.",

  "Romans-1-16": "16\u00a0I am proud of the Good News, because it is the power God uses to save everyone who believes\u2014to save the Jews first, and now to save those who are not Jews.",
  "Romans-1-17": "17\u00a0The Good News shows how God makes people right with himself. God\u2019s way of making people right begins and ends with faith. As the Scriptures say, \u201cThe one who is right with God by faith will live forever.\u201d[c]",
  "Romans-1-18": "All People Have Done Wrong\u00a018\u00a0God shows his anger from heaven against all the evil and wrong things that people do. Their evil lives hide the truth they have.",
  "Romans-1-19": "19\u00a0This makes God angry because they have been shown what he is like. Yes, God has made it clear to them.",
  "Romans-1-20": "20\u00a0There are things about God that people cannot see\u2014his eternal power and all that makes him God. But since the beginning of the world, those things have been easy for people to understand. They are made clear in what God has made. So people have no excuse for the evil they do.",
  "Romans-1-21": "21\u00a0People knew God, but they did not honor him as God, and they did not thank him. Their ideas were all useless. There was not one good thought left in their foolish minds.",
  "Romans-1-22": "22\u00a0They said they were wise, but they became fools.",
  "Romans-1-23": "23\u00a0Instead of honoring the divine greatness of God, who lives forever, they traded it for the worship of idols\u2014things made to look like humans, who get sick and die, or like birds, animals, and snakes.",
  "Romans-1-24": "24\u00a0People wanted only to do evil. So God left them and let them go their sinful way. And so they became completely immoral and used their bodies in shameful ways with each other.",
  "Romans-1-25": "25\u00a0They traded the truth of God for a lie. They bowed down and worshiped the things God made instead of worshiping the God who made those things. He is the one who should be praised forever. Amen.",
  "Romans-1-26": "26\u00a0Because people did those things, God left them and let them do the shameful things they wanted to do. Women stopped having natural sex with men and started having sex with other women.",
  "Romans-1-27": "27\u00a0In the same way, men stopped having natural sex with women and began wanting each other all the time. Men did shameful things with other men, and in their bodies they received the punishment for those wrongs.",
  "Romans-1-28": "28\u00a0People did not think it was important to have a true knowledge of God. So God left them and allowed them to have their own worthless thinking. And so they do what they should not do.",
  "Romans-1-29": "29\u00a0They are filled with every kind of sin, evil, greed, and hatred. They are full of jealousy, murder, fighting, lying, and thinking the worst things about each other. They gossip",
  "Romans-1-30": "30\u00a0and say evil things about each other. They hate God. They are rude, proud, and brag about themselves. They invent ways of doing evil. They don\u2019t obey their parents,",
  "Romans-1-31": "31\u00a0they are foolish, they don\u2019t keep their promises, and they show no kindness or mercy to others.",
  "Romans-1-32": "32\u00a0They know God\u2019s law says that anyone who lives like that should die. But they not only continue to do these things themselves, but they also encourage others who do them.",
  "Romans-2-1": "Let God Be the Judge\u00a02\u00a0So do you think that you can judge those other people? You are wrong. You too are guilty of sin. You judge them, but you do the same things they do. So when you judge them, you are really condemning yourself.",
  "Romans-2-2": "2\u00a0God judges all who do such things, and we know his judgment is right.",
  "Romans-2-3": "3\u00a0And since you do the same things as those people you judge, surely you understand that God will punish you too. How could you think you would be able to escape his judgment?",
  "Romans-2-4": "4\u00a0God has been kind to you. He has been very patient, waiting for you to change. But you think nothing of his kindness. Maybe you don\u2019t understand that God is kind to you so that you will decide to change your lives.",
  "Romans-2-5": "5\u00a0But you are so stubborn! You refuse to change. So you are making your own punishment greater and greater. You will be punished on the day when God will show his anger. On that day everyone will see how right God is to judge people.",
  "Romans-2-6": "6\u00a0He will reward or punish everyone for what they have done.",
  "Romans-2-7": "7\u00a0Some people live for God\u2019s glory, for honor, and for life that cannot be destroyed. They live for those things by always continuing to do good. God will give eternal life to them.",
  "Romans-2-8": "8\u00a0But others are selfish and refuse to follow truth. They follow evil. God will show his anger and punish them.",

  "Romans-2-11": "11\u00a0God judges everyone the same. It doesn\u2019t matter who they are.",
  "Romans-2-12": "12\u00a0People who have the law and those who have never heard of the law are all the same when they sin. People who don\u2019t have the law and are sinners will be lost. And, in the same way, those who have the law and are sinners will be judged by the law.",
  "Romans-2-13": "13\u00a0Hearing the law does not make people right with God. They will be right before him only if they always do what the law says.",
  "Romans-2-14": "14\u00a0Those who are not Jews don\u2019t have the law. But when they naturally do what the law commands without even knowing the law, then they are their own law. This is true even though they don\u2019t have the written law.",
  "Romans-2-15": "15\u00a0They show that in their hearts they know what is right and wrong, the same as the law commands, and their consciences agree. Sometimes their thoughts tell them that they have done wrong, and this makes them guilty. And sometimes their thoughts tell them that they have done right, and this makes them not guilty.",
  "Romans-2-16": "16\u00a0All this will happen on the day when God will judge people\u2019s secret thoughts through Jesus Christ. This is part of the Good News that I tell everyone.",
  "Romans-2-17": "The Jews and the Law\u00a017\u00a0What about you? You say you are a Jew. You trust in the law and proudly claim to be close to God.",
  "Romans-2-18": "18\u00a0You know what God wants you to do. And you know what is important, because you have learned the law.",
  "Romans-2-19": "19\u00a0You think you are a guide for people who don\u2019t know the right way, a light for those who are in the dark.",
  "Romans-2-20": "20\u00a0You think you can show foolish people what is right. And you think you are a teacher for those who are just beginning to learn. You have the law, and so you think you know everything and have all truth.",
  "Romans-2-21": "21\u00a0You teach others, so why don\u2019t you teach yourself? You tell them not to steal, but you yourself steal.",
  "Romans-2-22": "22\u00a0You say they must not commit adultery, but you yourself are guilty of that sin. You hate idols, but you steal them from their temples.",
  "Romans-2-23": "23\u00a0You are so proud that you have God\u2019s law, but you bring shame to God by breaking his law.",
  "Romans-2-24": "24\u00a0As the Scriptures say, \u201cPeople in other nations insult God because of you.\u201d[a]",
  "Romans-2-25": "25\u00a0If you follow the law, then your circumcision has meaning. But if you break the law, then it is as if you were never circumcised.",
  "Romans-2-26": "26\u00a0Those who are not Jews are not circumcised. But if they do what the law says, it is as if they were circumcised.",
  "Romans-2-27": "27\u00a0You have the written law and circumcision, but you break the law. So those who are not circumcised in their bodies, but still obey the law, will show that you are guilty.",
  "Romans-2-28": "28\u00a0You are not a true Jew if you are only a Jew in your physical body. True circumcision is not only on the outside of the body.",
  "Romans-2-29": "29\u00a0A true Jew is one who is a Jew inside. True circumcision is done in the heart. It is done by the Spirit, not by the written law. And anyone who is circumcised in the heart by the Spirit gets praise from God, not from people.",
  "Romans-3-1": "3\u00a0So, do Jews have anything that others don\u2019t have? Do they get any benefit from being circumcised?",
  "Romans-3-2": "2\u00a0Yes, the Jews have many benefits. The most important one is this: God trusted the Jews with his teachings.",
  "Romans-3-3": "3\u00a0It is true that some Jews were not faithful to God. But will that stop God from doing what he promised?",
  "Romans-3-4": "4\u00a0No, even if everyone else is a liar, God will always do what he says. As the Scriptures say about him,\u00a0\u201cYou will be proved right in what you say,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and you will win when people accuse you.\u201d (A)\u00a0and you will win when people accuse you.\u201d (A)",
  "Romans-3-5": "5\u00a0When we do wrong, that shows more clearly that God is right. So can we say that God does wrong when he punishes us? (That\u2019s the way some people think.)",
  "Romans-3-6": "6\u00a0Of course not. If God could not punish us, how could he judge the world?",
  "Romans-3-7": "7\u00a0Someone might say, \u201cWhen I lie, it really gives God glory, because my lie makes his truth easier to see. So why am I judged a sinner?\u201d",
  "Romans-3-8": "8\u00a0It would be the same to say, \u201cWe should do evil so that good will come.\u201d Many people criticize us, saying that\u2019s what we teach. They are wrong, and they should be condemned for saying that.",
  "Romans-3-9": "All People Are Guilty\u00a09\u00a0So are we Jews better than other people? No, we have already said that those who are Jews, as well as those who are not Jews, are the same. They are all guilty of sin.",
  "Romans-3-10": "10\u00a0As the Scriptures say,\u00a0\u201cThere is no one doing what is right,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0not even one.\u00a0not even one.",
  "Romans-3-11": "11\u00a0There is no one who understands.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is no one who is trying to be with God.\u00a0There is no one who is trying to be with God.",
  "Romans-3-12": "12\u00a0They have all turned away from him,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and now they are of no use to anyone.\u00a0and now they are of no use to anyone.\u00a0There is no one who does good,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0not even one.\u201d (B)\u00a0not even one.\u201d (B)",

  "Romans-3-19": "19\u00a0What the law says is for those who are under the law. It stops anyone from making excuses. And it brings the whole world under God\u2019s judgment,",
  "Romans-3-20": "20\u00a0because no one can be made right with God by following the law. The law only shows us our sin.",
  "Romans-3-21": "How God Makes People Right\u00a021\u00a0But God has a way to make people right, and it has nothing to do with the law. He has now shown us that new way, which the law and the prophets told us about.",
  "Romans-3-22": "22\u00a0God makes people right through their faith in[a] Jesus Christ. He does this for all who believe in Christ. Everyone is the same.",

  "Romans-3-24": "24\u00a0They are made right with God by his grace. This is a free gift. They are made right with God by being made free from sin through Jesus Christ.",
  "Romans-3-25-Rom-3-26": "25-26\u00a0God gave Jesus as a way to forgive people\u2019s sins through their faith in him. God can forgive them because the blood sacrifice of Jesus pays for their sins. God gave Jesus to show that he always does what is right and fair. He was right in the past when he was patient and did not punish people for their sins. And in our own time he still does what is right. God worked all this out in a way that allows him to judge people fairly and still make right any person who has faith in Jesus.",
  "Romans-3-27": "27\u00a0So do we have any reason to boast about ourselves? No reason at all. And why not? Because we are depending on the way of faith, not on what we have done in following the law.",
  "Romans-3-28": "28\u00a0I mean we are made right with God through faith, not through what we have done to follow the law. This is what we believe.",
  "Romans-3-29": "29\u00a0God is not only the God of the Jews. He is also the God of those who are not Jews.",
  "Romans-3-30": "30\u00a0There is only one God. He will make Jews[b] right with him by their faith, and he will also make non-Jews[c] right with him through their faith.",
  "Romans-3-31": "31\u00a0So do we destroy the law by following the way of faith? Not at all! In fact, faith causes us to be what the law actually wants.",
  "Romans-4-1": "The Example of Abraham\u00a04\u00a0So what can we say about Abraham, the father of our people? What did he learn about faith?",
  "Romans-4-2": "2\u00a0If Abraham was made right by the things he did, he had a reason to boast about himself. But God knew different.",
  "Romans-4-3": "3\u00a0That\u2019s why the Scriptures say, \u201cAbraham believed God, and because of this he was accepted as one who is right with God.\u201d[a]",

  "Romans-4-5": "5\u00a0But people cannot do any work that will make them right with God. So they must trust in him. Then he accepts their faith, and that makes them right with him. He is the one who makes even evil people right.",
  "Romans-4-6": "6\u00a0David said the same thing when he was talking about the blessing people have when God accepts them as good without looking at what they have done:",

  "Romans-4-9": "9\u00a0Is this blessing only for those who are circumcised? Or is it also for those who are not circumcised? We have already said that it was because of Abraham\u2019s faith that he was accepted as one who is right with God.",
  "Romans-4-10": "10\u00a0So how did this happen? Did God accept Abraham before or after he was circumcised? God accepted him before his circumcision.",
  "Romans-4-11": "11\u00a0Abraham was circumcised later to show that God accepted him. His circumcision was proof that he was right with God through faith before he was circumcised. So Abraham is the father of all those who believe but are not circumcised. They believe and are accepted as people who are right with God.",
  "Romans-4-12": "12\u00a0And Abraham is also the father of those who have been circumcised. But it is not their circumcision that makes him their father. He is their father only if they live following the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.",
  "Romans-4-13": "God\u2019s Promise Received Through Faith\u00a013\u00a0Abraham and his descendants received the promise that they would get the whole world. But Abraham did not receive that promise because he followed the law. He received that promise because he was right with God through his faith.",
  "Romans-4-14": "14\u00a0If people could get God\u2019s promise by following the law, then faith is worthless. And God\u2019s promise to Abraham is worthless,",
  "Romans-4-15": "15\u00a0because the law can only bring God\u2019s anger on those who disobey it. But if there is no law, then there is nothing to disobey.",
  "Romans-4-16": "16\u00a0So people get what God promised by having faith. This happens so that the promise can be a free gift. And if the promise is a free gift, then all of Abraham\u2019s people will get that promise. The promise is not just for those who live under the Law of Moses. It is for all who live with faith as Abraham did. He is the father of us all.",
  "Romans-4-17": "17\u00a0As the Scriptures say, \u201cI have made you a father of many nations.\u201d[b] This is true before God, the one Abraham believed\u2014the God who gives life to the dead and speaks of things that don\u2019t yet exist as if they are real.",
  "Romans-4-18": "18\u00a0There was no hope that Abraham would have children, but Abraham believed God and continued to hope. And that is why he became the father of many nations. As God told him, \u201cYou will have many descendants.\u201d[c]",
  "Romans-4-19": "19\u00a0Abraham was almost a hundred years old, so he was past the age for having children. Also, Sarah could not have children. Abraham was well aware of this, but his faith in God never became weak.",
  "Romans-4-20": "20\u00a0He never doubted that God would do what he promised. He never stopped believing. In fact, he grew stronger in his faith and just praised God.",

  "Romans-5-3": "3\u00a0And we are also happy with the troubles we have. Why are we happy with troubles? Because we know that these troubles make us more patient.",
  "Romans-5-4": "4\u00a0And this patience is proof that we are strong. And this proof gives us hope.",
  "Romans-5-5": "5\u00a0And this hope will never disappoint us. We know this because God has poured out his love to fill our hearts through the Holy Spirit he gave us.",

  "Romans-5-9": "9\u00a0We have been made right with God by the blood sacrifice of Christ. So through Christ we will surely be saved from God\u2019s anger.",
  "Romans-5-10": "10\u00a0I mean that while we were God\u2019s enemies, he made friends with us through his Son\u2019s death. And the fact that we are now God\u2019s friends makes it even more certain that he will save us through his Son\u2019s life.",
  "Romans-5-11": "11\u00a0And not only will we be saved, but we also rejoice right now in what God has done for us through our Lord Jesus Christ. It is because of Jesus that we are now God\u2019s friends.",
  "Romans-5-12": "Adam and Christ\u00a012\u00a0Sin came into the world because of what one man did. And with sin came death. So this is why all people must die\u2014because all people have sinned.",

  "Romans-5-14": "14\u00a0But from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, everyone had to die. Adam died because he sinned by not obeying God\u2019s command. But even those who did not sin that same way had to die.\u00a0That one man, Adam, can be compared to Christ, the one who was coming in the future.",
  "Romans-5-15": "15\u00a0But God\u2019s free gift is not like Adam\u2019s sin. Many people died because of the sin of that one man. But the grace that people received from God was much greater. Many received God\u2019s gift of life by the grace of this other man, Jesus Christ.",
  "Romans-5-16": "16\u00a0After Adam sinned once, he was judged guilty. But the gift of God is different. His free gift came after many sins, and it makes people right with him.",
  "Romans-5-17": "17\u00a0One man sinned, and so death ruled all people because of that one man. But now some people accept God\u2019s full grace and his great gift of being made right. Surely they will have true life and rule through the one man, Jesus Christ.",
  "Romans-5-18": "18\u00a0So that one sin of Adam brought the punishment of death to all people. But in the same way, Christ did something so good that it makes all people right with God. And that brings them true life.",
