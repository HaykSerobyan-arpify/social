  "3John-1-1": "1\u00a0Greetings from the Elder.[a]\u00a0To my dear friend Gaius, a person I truly love.",
  "3John-1-2": "2\u00a0My dear friend, I know that you are doing well spiritually. So I pray that everything else is going well with you and that you are enjoying good health.",
  "3John-1-3": "3\u00a0Some believers came and told me about the truth[b] in your life. They told me that you continue to follow the way of truth. This made me very happy.",
  "3John-1-4": "4\u00a0It always gives me the greatest joy when I hear that my children are following the way of truth.",
  "3John-1-5": "5\u00a0My dear friend, it is good that you continue to help the believers. They are people you don\u2019t even know.",
  "3John-1-6": "6\u00a0They told the church about the love you have. Please help them to continue their trip. Help them in a way that will please God.",
  "3John-1-7": "7\u00a0They went on their trip to serve Christ. They did not accept any help from people who are not believers.",
  "3John-1-8": "8\u00a0So we should help them. When we help them, we share with their work for the truth.",
  "3John-1-9": "9\u00a0I wrote a letter to the church, but Diotrephes will not listen to what we say. He always wants to be the leader.",
  "3John-1-10": "10\u00a0When I come, I will talk with him about what he is doing. He lies and says evil things about us, but that is not all. He refuses to welcome and help the believers who travel there. And he will not let others help them. If they do, he stops them from meeting with the church anymore.",
  "3John-1-11": "11\u00a0My dear friend, don\u2019t follow what is bad; follow what is good. Whoever does what is good is from God. But whoever does evil has never known God.",
  "3John-1-12": "12\u00a0Everyone says good things about Demetrius, and the truth agrees with what they say. Also, we say good about him. And you know that what we say is true.",
  "3John-1-13": "13\u00a0I have many things I want to tell you. But I don\u2019t want to use pen and ink.",
  "3John-1-14": "14\u00a0I hope to visit you soon. Then we can be together and talk.",
  "3John-1-15": "15\u00a0Peace to you. The friends here with me send their love. Please give our love to each one of the friends there."
