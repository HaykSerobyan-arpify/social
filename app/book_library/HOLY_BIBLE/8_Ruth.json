  "Ruth-1-1": "Famine in Judah\u00a01\u00a0Long ago, during the time the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land, and a man named Elimelech left the town of Bethlehem in Judah. He, his wife, and his two sons moved to the country of Moab.",
  "Ruth-1-2": "2\u00a0The man\u2019s wife was named Naomi, and his two sons were named Mahlon and Kilion. They were from the Ephrathah family of Bethlehem in Judah. The family traveled to the hill country of Moab and stayed there.",
  "Ruth-1-3": "3\u00a0Later, Naomi\u2019s husband, Elimelech, died, so only Naomi and her two sons were left.",
  "Ruth-1-4": "4\u00a0Her sons married women from the country of Moab. One wife\u2019s name was Orpah, and the other wife\u2019s name was Ruth. They lived in Moab about ten years;",
  "Ruth-1-5": "5\u00a0then Mahlon and Kilion also died. So Naomi was left alone without her husband or her two sons.",
  "Ruth-1-6": "Naomi Goes Home\u00a06\u00a0While Naomi was in the country of Moab, she heard that the Lord had helped his people. He had given food to his people in Judah. So Naomi decided to leave the hill country of Moab and go back home. Her daughters-in-law also decided to go with her.",
  "Ruth-1-7": "7\u00a0They left the place where they had been living and started walking back to the land of Judah.",
  "Ruth-1-8": "8\u00a0Then Naomi told her daughters-in-law, \u201cEach of you should go back home to your mother. You have been very kind to me and my sons who are now dead. So I pray that the Lord will be just as kind to you.",
  "Ruth-1-9": "9\u00a0I pray that the Lord will help each of you find a husband and a good home.\u201d Naomi kissed her daughters-in-law, and they all started crying.",
  "Ruth-1-10": "10\u00a0Then the daughters said, \u201cBut we want to come with you and go to your family.\u201d",
  "Ruth-1-11": "11\u00a0But Naomi said, \u201cNo, daughters, go back to your own homes. Why should you go with me? I can\u2019t have any more sons to be your husbands.",
  "Ruth-1-12": "12\u00a0Go back home. I am too old to have a new husband. Even if I thought I could be married again, I could not help you. If I became pregnant tonight and had two sons,",
  "Ruth-1-13": "13\u00a0you would have to wait until they grew to become men before you could marry them. I cannot make you wait that long for husbands. That would make me very sad. And I am already sad enough\u2014the Lord has done many things to me!\u201d",
  "Ruth-1-14": "14\u00a0So again they cried very much. Then Orpah kissed Naomi goodbye, but Ruth hugged her and stayed.",
  "Ruth-1-15": "15\u00a0Naomi said, \u201cLook, your sister-in-law has gone back to her own people and her own gods. You should do the same.\u201d",
  "Ruth-1-16": "16\u00a0But Ruth said, \u201cDon\u2019t force me to leave you! Don\u2019t force me to go back to my own people. Let me go with you. Wherever you go, I will go. Wherever you sleep, I will sleep. Your people will be my people. Your God will be my God.",
  "Ruth-1-17": "17\u00a0Where you die, I will die, and that is where I will be buried. I ask the Lord to punish me if I don\u2019t keep this promise: Only death will separate us.\u201d[a]",
  "Ruth-1-18": "The Homecoming\u00a018\u00a0Naomi saw that Ruth wanted very much to go with her. So Naomi stopped arguing with her.",
  "Ruth-1-19": "19\u00a0Naomi and Ruth traveled until they came to the town of Bethlehem. When the two women entered Bethlehem, all the people were very excited. They said, \u201cIs this Naomi?\u201d",
  "Ruth-1-20": "20\u00a0But Naomi told the people, \u201cDon\u2019t call me Naomi[b]; call me Marah.[c] Use this name because God All-Powerful has made my life very sad.",
  "Ruth-1-21": "21\u00a0I had everything I wanted when I left, but now, the Lord brings me home with nothing. The Lord has made me sad, so why should you call me \u2018Happy\u2019[d]? God All-Powerful has given much trouble to me.\u201d",
  "Ruth-1-22": "22\u00a0So Naomi and her daughter-in-law Ruth, the Moabite, came back from the hill country of Moab. These two women came to Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.",
  "Ruth-2-1": "Ruth Meets Boaz\u00a02\u00a0There was a rich man named Boaz living in Bethlehem. Boaz was one of Naomi\u2019s close relatives[a] from Elimelech\u2019s family.",
  "Ruth-2-2": "2\u00a0One day Ruth, the Moabite, said to Naomi, \u201cI think I will go to the fields. Maybe I can find someone who will be kind to me and let me gather the grain they leave in their field.\u201d\u00a0Naomi said, \u201cFine, daughter, go ahead.\u201d",
  "Ruth-2-3": "3\u00a0So Ruth went to the fields. She followed the workers who were cutting the grain and gathered the grain that was left.[b] It happened that part of the field belonged to Boaz, the man from Elimelech\u2019s family.",
  "Ruth-2-4": "4\u00a0Later, Boaz came to the field from Bethlehem and greeted his workers. He said, \u201cThe Lord be with you!\u201d\u00a0And the workers answered, \u201cAnd may the Lord bless you!\u201d",
  "Ruth-2-5": "5\u00a0Then Boaz spoke to his servant who was in charge of the workers. He asked, \u201cWhose girl is that?\u201d",
  "Ruth-2-6": "6\u00a0The servant answered, \u201cShe is the Moabite woman who came with Naomi from the country of Moab.",
  "Ruth-2-7": "7\u00a0She came early this morning and asked me if she could follow the workers and gather the grain that was left on the ground. She rested only a short time in that shelter.\u201d[c]",
  "Ruth-2-8": "8\u00a0Then Boaz said to Ruth, \u201cListen, child. Stay here in my field to gather grain for yourself. There is no need for you to go to any other field. Continue following behind my women workers.",
  "Ruth-2-9": "9\u00a0Watch to see which fields they go into to cut the grain and follow them. I have warned the young men not to bother you. When you are thirsty, go and drink from the same water jug my men drink from.\u201d",
  "Ruth-2-10": "10\u00a0Then Ruth bowed very low to the ground. She said to Boaz, \u201cI am a foreigner, so I am surprised you even noticed me.\u201d",
  "Ruth-2-11": "11\u00a0Boaz answered her, \u201cI know about all the help you have given to your mother-in-law Naomi. I know you helped her even after your husband died. And I know that you left your father and mother and your own country and came here to this country. You did not know anyone from this country, but you came here with Naomi.",
  "Ruth-2-12": "12\u00a0The Lord will reward you for all the good things you have done. The Lord, the God of Israel, will pay you in full. You have come to him for safety,[d] and he will protect you.\u201d",
  "Ruth-2-13": "13\u00a0Then Ruth said, \u201cI hope I can continue to please you, sir. You are very kind. I am only a servant and not even one of your own servants. But you have said kind words to me and comforted me.\u201d",
  "Ruth-2-14": "14\u00a0At mealtime, Boaz told Ruth, \u201cCome and eat some of our bread. Here, dip your bread in our vinegar.\u201d\u00a0So Ruth sat down with the workers. Boaz gave her some roasted grain. Ruth ate until she was full, and there was some food left.",
  "Ruth-2-15": "15\u00a0Then Ruth got up and went back to work.\u00a0Then Boaz told his servants, \u201cLet Ruth gather even around the piles of grain. Don\u2019t stop her.",
  "Ruth-2-16": "16\u00a0And make her work easier by dropping some full heads of grain for her. Let her gather that grain. Don\u2019t tell her to stop.\u201d",
  "Ruth-2-17": "Naomi Hears About Boaz\u00a017\u00a0Ruth worked in the fields until evening. Then she separated the grain from the chaff. There was about one-half bushel[e] of barley.",
  "Ruth-2-18": "18\u00a0Ruth carried the grain into town to show her mother-in-law what she had gathered. She also gave her the food that was left from lunch.",
  "Ruth-2-19": "19\u00a0Her mother-in-law asked her, \u201cWhere did you gather all this grain? Where did you work? Bless the man who noticed you.\u201d\u00a0Then Ruth told her who she had worked with. She said, \u201cThe man I worked with today is a man named Boaz.\u201d",
  "Ruth-2-20": "20\u00a0Naomi told her daughter-in-law, \u201cThe Lord bless him! He has continued showing his kindness to the living as well as the dead.\u201d Then Naomi told her daughter-in-law, \u201cBoaz is one of our relatives. He is one of our protectors.[f]\u201d",
  "Ruth-2-21": "21\u00a0Then Ruth said, \u201cBoaz also told me to come back and continue working. He said that I should work closely with his servants until the harvest is finished.\u201d",
  "Ruth-2-22": "22\u00a0Then Naomi said to her daughter-in-law Ruth, \u201cIt is good for you to continue working with his women servants. If you work in another field, some man might hurt you.\u201d",
  "Ruth-2-23": "23\u00a0So Ruth continued working closely with the women servants of Boaz. She gathered grain until the barley harvest was finished. She also worked there through the end of the wheat harvest. Ruth continued living with her mother-in-law Naomi.",
  "Ruth-3-1": "The Threshing Floor\u00a03\u00a0Then Naomi, Ruth\u2019s mother-in-law, said to her, \u201cMy daughter, maybe I should find a husband and a good home for you. That would be good for you.",
  "Ruth-3-2": "2\u00a0Boaz is our close relative.[a] You worked with his women servants. Tonight he will be working at the threshing floor.",
  "Ruth-3-3": "3\u00a0Go wash yourself and get dressed. Put on a nice dress, and go down to the threshing floor. But don\u2019t let Boaz see you until he has finished eating his dinner.",
  "Ruth-3-4": "4\u00a0After he eats, he will lie down to rest. Watch him so that you will know where he lies down. Go there and lift the cover off his feet.[b] Then lie down there with Boaz. He will tell you what you should do about marriage.\u201d",
  "Ruth-3-5": "5\u00a0Then Ruth answered, \u201cI will do what you say.\u201d",
  "Ruth-3-6": "6\u00a0So Ruth went down to the threshing floor and did everything that her mother-in-law told her to do.",
  "Ruth-3-7": "7\u00a0After eating and drinking, Boaz was very satisfied. He went to lie down near the pile of grain. Then Ruth went to him very quietly and lifted the cover from his feet and lay down by his feet.",
  "Ruth-3-8": "8\u00a0About midnight, Boaz rolled over in his sleep and woke up. He was very surprised. There was a woman lying near his feet.",
  "Ruth-3-9": "9\u00a0Boaz said, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\u00a0She said, \u201cI am Ruth, your servant girl. Spread your cover over me.[c] You are my protector.\u201d",
  "Ruth-3-10": "10\u00a0Then Boaz said, \u201cMay the Lord bless you, young woman. You have been very kind to me. Your kindness to me is greater than the kindness you showed to Naomi in the beginning. You could have looked for a young man to marry, rich or poor. But you did not.",
  "Ruth-3-11": "11\u00a0Now, young woman, don\u2019t be afraid. I will do what you ask. All the people in our town know that you are a very good woman.",
  "Ruth-3-12": "12\u00a0And it is true that I am a close relative. But there is a man who is a closer relative to you than I am.",
  "Ruth-3-13": "13\u00a0Stay here tonight. In the morning we will see if he will help[d] you. If he decides to help you, that is fine. If he refuses to help, I promise, as surely as the Lord lives, I will marry you and buy back Elimelech\u2019s land for you.[e] So lie here until morning.\u201d",
  "Ruth-3-14": "14\u00a0So Ruth lay near Boaz\u2019s feet until morning. She got up while it was still dark, before it was light enough for people to recognize each other.\u00a0Boaz said to her, \u201cWe will keep it a secret that you came here to me last night.\u201d",
  "Ruth-3-15": "15\u00a0Then he said, \u201cBring me your coat. Now, hold it open.\u201d\u00a0So Ruth held her coat open, and Boaz measured out about a bushel of barley[f] as a gift to Naomi, her mother-in-law. Boaz then wrapped it in Ruth\u2019s coat, and put it on her back. Then he went to the city.",
  "Ruth-3-16": "16\u00a0Ruth went to the home of her mother-in-law, Naomi. Naomi went to the door and asked, \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d\u00a0Ruth went in telling Naomi everything that Boaz did for her.",
  "Ruth-3-17": "17\u00a0She said, \u201cBoaz gave me this barley as a gift for you. He said that I must not go home without bringing a gift for you.\u201d",
  "Ruth-3-18": "18\u00a0Naomi said, \u201cDaughter, be patient until we hear what happens. Boaz will not rest until he has finished doing what he should do. We will know what will happen before the day is ended.\u201d",
  "Ruth-4-1": "Boaz and Naomi\u2019s Close Relative\u00a04\u00a0Boaz went to the place where people gather near the city gates. He sat there until the close relative he had told Ruth about passed by. Boaz called to him, \u201cCome and sit here, friend.\u201d",
  "Ruth-4-2": "2\u00a0Boaz also gathered ten of the elders of the city. He told them, \u201cSit here!\u201d So they sat down.",
  "Ruth-4-3": "3\u00a0Then Boaz spoke to Naomi\u2019s close relative. He said, \u201cNaomi came back from the hill country of Moab. She wants to sell the land that belonged to our relative Elimelech.",
  "Ruth-4-4": "4\u00a0I decided to tell you about this in front of the people living here and in front of the elders of our people. If you want to pay the widow for the land and keep it in the family, then pay her for it. If you don\u2019t want to buy the land, tell me, because I am the next one in the family who has the right to buy it. If you don\u2019t buy the land from her, I will.\u201d\u00a0Naomi\u2019s closest relative said, \u201cI will buy the land from her.\u201d",
  "Ruth-4-5": "5\u00a0Then Boaz said, \u201cIf you buy the land from her, you must also marry the dead man\u2019s wife, Ruth, the Moabite woman. Then the first child will get the land, and it will stay in the dead man\u2019s family.\u201d",
  "Ruth-4-6": "6\u00a0The close relative answered, \u201cThen I cannot buy the land. If I do, I might lose my own land. So I cannot do it. You buy the land.\u201d",
  "Ruth-4-7": "7\u00a0Then he gave Boaz something to show that he was serious. During that time in Israel, when people bought property, one person took off a sandal and gave it to the other person. This was like signing an agreement.",
  "Ruth-4-8": "8\u00a0So when the close relative said to Boaz, \u201cYou buy the land,\u201d he took off his sandal and gave it to Boaz.[a]",
  "Ruth-4-9": "9\u00a0Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, \u201cYou are witnesses today that I am buying from Naomi everything that belonged to Elimelech, Kilion, and Mahlon.",
  "Ruth-4-10": "10\u00a0I also take Ruth to be my wife. Then the dead man\u2019s property will continue to belong to his family. And he will always be remembered by his family and the people in his hometown. You are all witnesses of what I am doing today.\u201d",
  "Ruth-4-11": "11\u00a0So all the elders and the people who were near the city gates said, \u201cWe are witnesses to all of this. And may the Lord bless this woman who is coming into your home to be like Rachel and Leah. They are the ones who had many children to make the people of Israel strong. And may you become powerful in the tribe of Ephrathah and famous in Bethlehem!",
  "Ruth-4-12": "12\u00a0May the Lord bless you with many children through Ruth. May your family become great like the family of Perez,[b] the son Tamar bore for Judah.\u201d",
  "Ruth-4-13": "13\u00a0So Boaz married Ruth. The Lord allowed Ruth to become pregnant, and she had a son.",
  "Ruth-4-14": "14\u00a0The women there said to Naomi, \u201cPraise the Lord who gave you this child.[c] May he become famous in Israel.",
  "Ruth-4-15": "15\u00a0He will make you alive again and care for you in your old age. Your daughter-in-law made it happen because she bore this child for you. She loves you, and she is better for you than seven sons.\u201d",
  "Ruth-4-16": "16\u00a0Naomi took the boy, held him in her arms, and cared for him.",
  "Ruth-4-17": "17\u00a0The neighbors gave the boy his name. These women said, \u201cNaomi has a son now!\u201d[d] They named him Obed. Obed was the father of Jesse, and Jesse was the father of David.",
  "Ruth-4-18": "The Family of Ruth and Boaz\u00a018\u00a0This is the family history of Perez:\u00a0Perez was the father of Hezron.",
  "Ruth-4-19": "19\u00a0Hezron was the father of Ram.\u00a0Ram was the father of Amminadab.",
  "Ruth-4-20": "20\u00a0Amminadab was the father of Nahshon.\u00a0Nahshon was the father of Salmon.",
  "Ruth-4-21": "21\u00a0Salmon was the father of Boaz.\u00a0Boaz was the father of Obed.",
  "Ruth-4-22": "22\u00a0Obed was the father of Jesse.\u00a0Jesse was the father of David."
