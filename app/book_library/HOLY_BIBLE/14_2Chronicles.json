  "2Chronicles-1-10": "10\u00a0Now give me wisdom and knowledge so that I can lead these people in the right way. No one could rule this great nation without your help.\u201d",
  "2Chronicles-1-11": "11\u00a0God said to Solomon, \u201cYou have the right attitude. You did not ask for long life and riches for yourself. You did not ask for the death of your enemies. You asked for the wisdom and knowledge so that you can make the right decisions.",
  "2Chronicles-1-12": "12\u00a0So I will give you wisdom and knowledge, but I will also give you wealth, riches, and honor. No king who lived before you has ever had so much wealth and honor, and no king in the future will have as much wealth and honor.\u201d",
