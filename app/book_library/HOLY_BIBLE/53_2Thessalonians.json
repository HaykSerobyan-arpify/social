  "2Thessalonians-2-3": "3\u00a0Don\u2019t be fooled by anything they might say. That day of the Lord will not come until the turning away from God happens. And that day will not come until the Man of Evil appears, the one who belongs to hell.[a]",
  "2Thessalonians-2-4": "4\u00a0He will stand against and put himself above everything that people worship or think is worthy of worship. He will even go into God\u2019s Temple[b] and sit there, claiming that he is God.",
