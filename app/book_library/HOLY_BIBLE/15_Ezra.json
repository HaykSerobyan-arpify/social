  "Ezra-1-1": "Cyrus Helps the Prisoners Return\u00a01\u00a0During the first year[a] that Cyrus was king of Persia, the Lord caused him to make an announcement. It was written down, and Cyrus ordered that it be read throughout his kingdom. This was done so that what the Lord had told Jeremiah[b] years before would now happen. This was the announcement:",
  "Ezra-1-2": "2\u00a0From King Cyrus of Persia:\u00a0The Lord, the God of heaven, gave all the kingdoms on earth to me. And he chose me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in the country of Judah.",
  "Ezra-1-3": "3\u00a0If any of God\u2019s people are living among you, I pray God will bless them. You must let them go to Jerusalem in the country of Judah. You must let them go build the Temple of the Lord, the God of Israel, the God who is in Jerusalem.",
  "Ezra-1-4": "4\u00a0And so in any place where there might be survivors of Israel, the men in that place must support these survivors. Give them silver, gold, animals, and other things. Give them gifts for God\u2019s Temple in Jerusalem.",
  "Ezra-1-5": "5\u00a0So the family leaders from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin prepared to go up to Jerusalem. They were going to Jerusalem to build the Lord\u2019s Temple. Also everyone who God had encouraged prepared to go to Jerusalem.",

  "Ezra-2-69": "69\u00a0They gave as much as they were able. These are the things they gave for building the Temple: 1100 pounds[a] of gold, about 4 tons[b] of silver, and 100 coats that priests wear.",
  "Ezra-2-70": "70\u00a0So the priests, Levites, and some of the other people moved to Jerusalem and the area around it. This group included the Temple singers, gatekeepers, and the Temple servants. The other Israelites settled in their own hometowns.",
  "Ezra-3-1": "Rebuilding the Altar\u00a03\u00a0So by the seventh month,[a] the Israelites had moved back to their own hometowns. At that time all the people met together in Jerusalem. They were all united as one people.",
  "Ezra-3-2": "2\u00a0Then Jeshua son of Jozadak and the priests with him, along with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and the people with him, built the altar of the God of Israel. They built the altar of the God of Israel so that they could offer sacrifices on it. They built it just as it says in the Law of Moses. Moses was God\u2019s special servant.",
  "Ezra-3-3": "3\u00a0They were afraid of the other people living near them, but that didn\u2019t stop them. They built the altar on its old foundation and offered burnt offerings on it to the Lord. They offered sacrifices in the morning and in the evening.",
  "Ezra-3-4": "4\u00a0Then they celebrated the Festival of Shelters just as the Law of Moses said. They offered the right number of burnt offerings for each day of the festival.",
  "Ezra-3-5": "5\u00a0After that they began offering the continual burnt offerings each day and the offerings for the New Moon and all the other festivals that were commanded by the Lord. The people also began giving any other gifts they wanted to give to the Lord.",
  "Ezra-3-6": "6\u00a0So on the first day of the seventh month, these Israelites again began offering sacrifices to the Lord. This was done, even though the Lord\u2019s Temple had not been rebuilt.",
  "Ezra-3-7": "Rebuilding the Temple\u00a07\u00a0Then those who had come back from captivity gave money to the stonecutters and carpenters. They also gave food, wine, and olive oil. They used these things to pay the people of Tyre and Sidon to bring cedar logs from Lebanon. They wanted to bring the logs in ships to the seacoast town of Joppa as they did for the first Temple. King Cyrus of Persia gave permission for them to do this.",
  "Ezra-3-8": "8\u00a0So in the second month[b] of the second year after they came to the Temple in Jerusalem, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak began the work. Their brothers, the priests, Levites, and everyone who came back to Jerusalem from captivity began working with them. They chose Levites who were 20 years old and older to be the leaders in the building of the Lord\u2019s Temple.",
  "Ezra-3-9": "9\u00a0These were the men who supervised the work of building the Lord\u2019s Temple: Jeshua and his sons, Kadmiel and his sons (the descendants of Judah), the sons of Henadad and their brothers, the Levites.",
  "Ezra-3-10": "10\u00a0The builders finished laying the foundation for the Lord\u2019s Temple. When the foundation was finished, the priests put on their special clothing. Then they got their trumpets, and the sons of Asaph got their cymbals. They all took their places to praise the Lord. This was done the way King David of Israel had ordered in the past.",
  "Ezra-3-11": "11\u00a0They sang songs of praise and thanksgiving, taking turns in singing each part.[c] They sang,\u00a0\u201cThe Lord is good.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His faithful love will last forever.\u201d\u00a0His faithful love will last forever.\u201d\u00a0Then all the people cheered\u2014they gave a loud shout and praised the Lord because the foundation of the Lord\u2019s Temple had been laid.",
  "Ezra-3-12": "12\u00a0But many of the older priests, Levites, and family leaders, who could remember seeing the first Temple, began to cry aloud. They cried while the others there shouted for joy.",
  "Ezra-3-13": "13\u00a0The sound could be heard far away. All of them made so much noise that no one could tell the difference between the shouts of joy and the crying.",
  "Ezra-4-1-Ezra-4-2": "Enemies Against Rebuilding the Temple\u00a04\u00a0Many people living in the area were against the people of Judah and Benjamin. These enemies heard that the people who had come from captivity were building a temple for the Lord, the God of Israel. So they came to Zerubbabel and to the family leaders and said, \u201cLet us help you build. We are the same as you, we ask your God for help. We have offered sacrifices to your God since the time King Esarhaddon of Assyria brought us here.\u201d",
  "Ezra-4-3": "3\u00a0But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the other family leaders of Israel answered, \u201cNo, you people cannot help us build a temple for our God. Only we can build the Temple for the Lord. He is the God of Israel. This is what King Cyrus of Persia commanded us to do.\u201d",
  "Ezra-4-4": "4\u00a0So the enemies began to discourage them and tried to frighten them in order to stop them from building the Temple.",
  "Ezra-4-5": "5\u00a0These enemies hired government officials to work against the people of Judah. The officials constantly did things to stop the Jews\u2019 plans to build the Temple. This continued the whole time that Cyrus was the king until Darius became the king of Persia.",
  "Ezra-4-6": "6\u00a0These enemies even wrote letters to the king of Persia trying to stop the Jews. They wrote a letter the year that Xerxes[a] became the king of Persia.",
  "Ezra-4-7": "Enemies Against Rebuilding Jerusalem\u00a07\u00a0Later, when Artaxerxes became the new king of Persia, some of these men wrote another letter complaining about the Jews. The men who wrote the letter were Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the other people in their group. The letter was written in Aramaic and translated.[b]",
  "Ezra-4-8": "8\u00a0[c] Then Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary wrote a letter against the people of Jerusalem. They wrote the letter to Artaxerxes the king. This is what they wrote:",
  "Ezra-4-9": "9\u00a0From Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary, and from the judges and important officials over the men from Tripolis, Persia, Erech, and Babylon, and from the Elamites from Susa,",
  "Ezra-4-10": "10\u00a0and from the other people who the great and powerful Ashurbanipal moved to the city of Samaria and other places in the country west of the Euphrates River.",
  "Ezra-4-11": "11\u00a0This is the copy of the letter sent to King Artaxerxes:\u00a0From your servants living in the area west of the Euphrates River.",
  "Ezra-4-12": "12\u00a0King Artaxerxes, we wish to inform you that the Jews you sent from there are now in Jerusalem. They are trying to rebuild that terrible city. The people there have always rebelled against other kings. Now they have almost finished repairing the foundations and building the walls.[d]",
  "Ezra-4-13": "13\u00a0Also, King Artaxerxes, you should know that if Jerusalem and its walls are rebuilt, the people of Jerusalem will stop paying their taxes. They will stop sending money to honor you. They also will stop paying customs fees, and the king will lose all that money.",
  "Ezra-4-14": "14\u00a0We have a responsibility to the king. We don\u2019t want to see this happen, so we are sending this letter to inform the king.",
  "Ezra-4-15": "15\u00a0King Artaxerxes, we suggest that you search the writings of the kings who ruled before you. You will see in the writings that Jerusalem always rebelled against other kings. It has caused much trouble for other kings and nations. Many rebellions have started in this city since ancient times. That is why Jerusalem was destroyed.",
  "Ezra-4-16": "16\u00a0King Artaxerxes, we wish to inform you that if this city and its walls are rebuilt, you will lose control of the area west of the Euphrates River.",
  "Ezra-4-17": "17\u00a0Then King Artaxerxes sent this answer:\u00a0To Rehum the commanding officer, Shimshai the secretary, and all the people with them living in Samaria and other places west of the Euphrates River.\u00a0Greetings:",
  "Ezra-4-18": "18\u00a0The letter you sent us has been translated and read to me.",
  "Ezra-4-19": "19\u00a0I gave an order for the writings of the kings before me to be searched. The writings were read, and we found out that Jerusalem has a long history of rebellion against kings. Jerusalem has been a place where rebellion and revolt has happened often.",
  "Ezra-4-20": "20\u00a0Jerusalem has had powerful kings ruling over it and over the whole area west of the Euphrates River. Their kings received taxes, customs, fees, and tribute.",
  "Ezra-4-21": "21\u00a0Now, you must give an order for these men to stop work. That order must be given to keep Jerusalem from being rebuilt until I say so.",
  "Ezra-4-22": "22\u00a0Be careful not to overlook this matter. We should not let the building of Jerusalem continue. If that work continues, I will not get any more money from Jerusalem.",
  "Ezra-4-23": "23\u00a0So a copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes sent was read to Rehum, Shimshai the secretary, and the people with them. They went very quickly to the Jews in Jerusalem and forced them to stop building.",
  "Ezra-4-24": "The Work on the Temple Stopped\u00a024\u00a0So the work stopped[e] on God\u2019s Temple in Jerusalem. The work did not continue until the second year[f] that Darius was king of Persia.",
  "Ezra-5-1": "5\u00a0At that time the prophets Haggai[a] and Zechariah son of Iddo[b] began to prophesy in the name of God. They encouraged the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem.",
  "Ezra-5-2": "2\u00a0So Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak again started working on the Temple in Jerusalem. All of God\u2019s prophets were with them and were supporting the work.",
  "Ezra-5-3": "3\u00a0At that time Tattenai was the governor of the area west of the Euphrates River. Tattenai, Shethar Bozenai, and the men with them went to Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the others who were building. Tattenai and the people with him asked Zerubbabel and the people with him, \u201cWho gave you permission to rebuild this Temple and repair it like new?\u201d",
  "Ezra-5-4": "4\u00a0They also asked Zerubbabel, \u201cWhat are the names of the men who are working on this building?\u201d",
  "Ezra-5-5": "5\u00a0But God was watching over the Jewish leaders. The builders didn\u2019t have to stop working until a report could be sent to King Darius. They continued working until the king sent his answer back.",
  "Ezra-5-6": "6\u00a0Tattenai the governor of the area west of the Euphrates River, Shethar Bozenai, and the important people with them sent a letter to King Darius.",
  "Ezra-5-7": "7\u00a0This is a copy of that letter:\u00a0To King Darius.\u00a0Greetings:",
  "Ezra-5-8": "8\u00a0King Darius, you should know that we went to the province of Judah. We went to the Temple of the great God. The people in Judah are building that Temple with large stones. They are putting big wooden timbers in the walls. The work is being done with much care and the people of Judah are working very hard. They are building very fast; it will soon be done.",
  "Ezra-5-9": "9\u00a0We asked their leaders some questions about the work they are doing. We asked them, \u201cWho gave you permission to rebuild this temple and repair it like new?\u201d",
  "Ezra-5-10": "10\u00a0We also asked for their names. We wanted to write down the names of their leaders so that you would know who they are.",
  "Ezra-5-11": "11\u00a0This is the answer they gave us:\u00a0\u201cWe are the servants of the God of heaven and earth. We are rebuilding the Temple that a great king of Israel built and finished many years ago.",
  "Ezra-5-12": "12\u00a0But our ancestors made the God of heaven angry, so God gave our ancestors to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar destroyed this Temple, and he forced the people to go to Babylon as prisoners.",
  "Ezra-5-13": "13\u00a0But, in the first year that Cyrus was king of Babylon, King Cyrus gave a special order for God\u2019s Temple to be rebuilt.",
  "Ezra-5-14": "14\u00a0And Cyrus brought out from his false god\u2019s temple in Babylon the gold and silver things that were taken from God\u2019s Temple in the past. Nebuchadnezzar took them from the Temple in Jerusalem and brought them to his false god\u2019s temple in Babylon. Then King Cyrus gave those gold and silver things to Sheshbazzar.\u201d Cyrus chose Sheshbazzar to be governor.",
  "Ezra-5-15": "15\u00a0Then Cyrus said to Sheshbazzar, \u201cTake these gold and silver things and put them back in the Temple in Jerusalem. Rebuild God\u2019s Temple in the same place it was in the past.\u201d",
  "Ezra-5-16": "16\u00a0So Sheshbazzar came and built the foundations of God\u2019s Temple in Jerusalem. From that day until now, the work has continued, but it is not yet finished.",
  "Ezra-5-17": "17\u00a0Now, if it pleases the king, please search the official records of the king. See if it is true that King Cyrus gave an order to rebuild God\u2019s Temple in Jerusalem. And then, sir, please send us a letter to let us know what you have decided to do about this.",
  "Ezra-6-1": "The Order of Darius\u00a06\u00a0So King Darius gave an order to search the writings of the kings before him. The writings were kept in Babylon in the same place the money was kept.",
  "Ezra-6-2": "2\u00a0A scroll was found in the fortress of Ecbatana. (Ecbatana is in the province of Media.) This is what was written on that scroll:\u00a0Official Note:",
  "Ezra-6-3": "3\u00a0During the first year that Cyrus was king, he gave an order about the Temple of God in Jerusalem. The order said:\u00a0Let the Temple of God be rebuilt. It will be a place to offer sacrifices. Let its foundations be built. The Temple must be 60 cubits[a] high and 60 cubits wide.",
  "Ezra-6-4": "4\u00a0Its wall will be in layers that have three rows of large stones[b] and one row of wooden timbers. The cost of building the Temple must be paid for from the king\u2019s treasury.",
  "Ezra-6-5": "5\u00a0Also, the gold and silver things from God\u2019s Temple must be put back in their places. Nebuchadnezzar took them from the Temple in Jerusalem and brought them to Babylon. They must be put back in God\u2019s Temple.",
  "Ezra-6-6": "6\u00a0So King Darius sent this message to his officials:\u00a0To Tattenai, governor of the area west of the Euphrates River, to Shethar Bozenai, and to all the officials living in that province. I order you to stay away from Jerusalem.",
  "Ezra-6-7": "7\u00a0Don\u2019t bother the workers. Don\u2019t try to stop the work on this Temple of God. Let the Jewish governor and the Jewish leaders rebuild it. Let them rebuild God\u2019s Temple in the same place it was in the past.",
  "Ezra-6-8": "8\u00a0Now I give this order. You must do this for the Jewish leaders building God\u2019s Temple: The cost of the building must be fully paid from the king\u2019s treasury. The money will come from the taxes collected from the provinces in the area west of the Euphrates River. Do these things quickly, so the work will not stop.",
  "Ezra-6-9": "9\u00a0Give them anything they need. If they need young bulls, rams, or male lambs for sacrifices to the God of heaven, give these things to them. If the priests of Jerusalem ask for wheat, salt, wine, and oil, give these things to them every day without fail.",
  "Ezra-6-10": "10\u00a0Give them to the Jewish priests so that they may offer sacrifices that please the God of heaven. Give these things so that the priests may pray for me and my sons.",
  "Ezra-6-11": "11\u00a0Also, I give this order: If anyone changes this order, a wooden beam must be pulled from their house and pushed through their body. Then their house must be destroyed until it is only a pile of rocks.",
  "Ezra-6-12": "12\u00a0God put his name there in Jerusalem. May God defeat any king or other person who tries to change this order. If anyone tries to destroy this Temple in Jerusalem, may God destroy that person.\u00a0I, Darius, have ordered it. This order must be obeyed quickly and completely.",

  "Ezra-6-14": "14\u00a0So the Jewish leaders continued to build. Encouraged by the preaching of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah son of Iddo, they had great success.

Other people washed themselves and made themselves pure from the unclean things of the people living in that country. These pure people also shared in the Passover meal. They did this so that they could go to the Lord, the God of Israel, for help.",

  "Ezra-8-21": "21\u00a0There near the Ahava River, I announced that we all should fast. We should fast to make ourselves humble before our God. We wanted to ask God for a safe trip for ourselves, our children, and for everything we owned.",
  "Ezra-8-22": "22\u00a0I was embarrassed to ask King Artaxerxes for soldiers and horsemen to protect us as we traveled. There were enemies on the road. The reason I was embarrassed to ask for protection was because of what we had told the king. We had said to King Artaxerxes, \u201cOur God is with everyone who trusts him, but he is very angry with everyone who turns away from him.\u201d",
  "Ezra-8-23": "23\u00a0So we fasted and prayed to our God about our trip. He answered our prayers.",

  "Ezra-8-25": "25\u00a0I weighed the silver, gold, and the other things that were given for God\u2019s Temple. I gave them to the twelve priests I had chosen. King Artaxerxes, his advisors, his important officials, and all the Israelites in Babylon gave those things for God\u2019s Temple.",

  "Ezra-8-29": "29\u00a0So guard these things carefully. You are responsible for them until you give them to the Temple leaders in Jerusalem.

  "Ezra-8-30": "30\u00a0So the priests and Levites accepted the silver, gold, and special things that Ezra had weighed and given to them. They were told to take them to God\u2019s Temple in Jerusalem.",
  "Ezra-8-31": "31\u00a0On the twelfth day of the first month,[d] we left the Ahava River and started toward Jerusalem. God was with us, and he protected us from enemies and robbers along the way.",

  "Ezra-8-33": "33\u00a0On the fourth day, we went to the Temple and weighed the silver, gold, and special things. We gave them to Meremoth son of Uriah the priest. Eleazar son of Phinehas was with Meremoth. The Levites, Jozabad son of Jeshua, and Noadiah son of Binnui were with them also.",
  "Ezra-8-34": "34\u00a0We counted and weighed everything and we wrote down the total weight.",
  "Ezra-8-35": "35\u00a0Then the Jewish people who came back from captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel. They offered twelve bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, 77 male lambs, and twelve male goats for a sin offering. All this was a burnt offering to the Lord.",
  "Ezra-8-36": "36\u00a0Then the people gave the letter from King Artaxerxes to the royal satraps and to the governors of the area west of the Euphrates River. Then the leaders gave their support to the Israelites and to the Temple.",
  "Ezra-9-1": "Marriages to Non-Jewish People\u00a09\u00a0After we finished all these things, the leaders of the Israelites came to me and said, \u201cEzra, the Israelites have not kept themselves separate from the other people living around us. And the priests and the Levites have not kept themselves separate. The Israelites are being influenced by evil things done by the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites.",
  "Ezra-9-2": "2\u00a0The Israelites have married the people living around us. The Israelites are supposed to be special, but now they are mixed with the other people living around them. The leaders and important officials of the Israelites have set a bad example in this thing.\u201d",
  "Ezra-9-3": "3\u00a0When I heard about this, I tore my robe and my coat to show I was upset. I pulled hair from my head and beard. I sat down, shocked and upset.",
  "Ezra-9-4": "4\u00a0Then everyone who respected God\u2019s Law shook with fear. They were afraid because the Israelites who came back from captivity were not faithful to God. I was shocked and upset. I sat there until the evening sacrifice, and the people gathered around me.",
  "Ezra-9-5": "5\u00a0Then, when it was time for the evening sacrifice, I got up. I had made myself look shameful while I was sitting there. My robe and coat were torn, and I fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the Lord my God.",
  "Ezra-9-6": "6\u00a0Then I prayed this prayer:\u00a0\u201cMy God, I am too ashamed and embarrassed to look at you. I am ashamed because our sins are higher than our heads. Our guilt has reached all the way up to the heavens.",
  "Ezra-9-7": "7\u00a0We have been guilty of many sins from the days of our ancestors until now. We sinned so our kings and priests were punished. Foreign kings attacked us and took our people away. They took away our wealth and made us ashamed. It is the same even today.",
  "Ezra-9-8": "8\u00a0\u201cBut now, finally, you have been kind to us. You have let a few of us escape captivity and come to live in this holy place. Lord, you gave us new life and relief from our slavery.",
  "Ezra-9-9": "9\u00a0Yes, we were slaves, but you would not let us be slaves forever. You were kind to us. You made the kings of Persia be kind to us. Your Temple was ruined, but you gave us new life so that we can rebuild your Temple and repair it like new. God, you helped us build a wall to protect Judah and Jerusalem.",
  "Ezra-9-10": "10\u00a0\u201cNow, God, what can we say to you? We have stopped obeying you again.",
  "Ezra-9-11": "11\u00a0You used your servants the prophets to give these commands to us. You said, \u2018The land you are going to live in and own is a ruined land. It has been ruined by evil things the people living there have done. They have done very bad things in every place in this land. They have made this land dirty with their sins.",
  "Ezra-9-12": "12\u00a0So Israelites, don\u2019t let your children marry their children. Don\u2019t join them. Don\u2019t want the things they have. Obey my commands so that you will be strong and enjoy the good things of the land. And then you can keep this land and give it to your children.\u2019",
  "Ezra-9-13": "13\u00a0\u201cWhat has happened to us is our own fault. We have done evil things, and we have much guilt. But you, our God, have punished us much less than we should have been. We have done many terrible sins, and we should have been punished worse. And you have even let some of our people escape captivity.",
  "Ezra-9-14": "14\u00a0So we know that we must not break your commands. We must not marry those people. They do very bad things. God, if we continue to marry these bad people, we know you will destroy us. Then there would be no one from the Israelites left alive.",
  "Ezra-9-15": "15\u00a0\u201cLord, God of Israel, you are good, and you still have let some of us live. Yes, we are guilty, and because of our guilt, not one of us should be allowed to stand in front of you.\u201d",
  "Ezra-10-1": "The People Confess Their Sin\u00a010\u00a0Ezra was praying and confessing. He was crying and bowing down in front of God\u2019s Temple. While Ezra was doing that, a large group of the Israelites\u2014men, women, and children\u2014gathered around him. They were crying.",
  "Ezra-10-2": "2\u00a0Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, one of the descendants of Elam, spoke to Ezra and said, \u201cWe have not been faithful to our God. We have married the people living around us. But, even though we have done this, there is still hope for Israel.",
  "Ezra-10-3": "3\u00a0Now let us make an agreement before our God to send away all these women and their children. We will do that to follow the advice of Ezra and the people who respect the laws of our God. We will obey God\u2019s law.",
  "Ezra-10-4": "4\u00a0Get up, Ezra. This is your responsibility, but we will support you. So be brave and do it.\u201d",
  "Ezra-10-5": "5\u00a0So Ezra got up. He made the leading priests, the Levites, and all the Israelites promise to do what he said.",
  "Ezra-10-6": "6\u00a0Then Ezra went away from the front of God\u2019s house. He went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While Ezra was there, he didn\u2019t eat food or drink water. He did that because he was still very sad. He was very sad about the Israelites who came back to Jerusalem.",
  "Ezra-10-7": "7\u00a0Then he sent a message to every place in Judah and Jerusalem. The message told all the Jewish people who had come back from captivity to meet together in Jerusalem.",
  "Ezra-10-8": "8\u00a0Those who did not come to Jerusalem in three days like the officials and elders said would lose their property and be removed from the group.",
  "Ezra-10-9": "9\u00a0So in three days all the men from the families of Judah and Benjamin gathered in Jerusalem. And on the twentieth day of the ninth month,[a] all the people met together in the Temple yard. They were very upset because of the reason for the meeting and because of the heavy rain.",
  "Ezra-10-10": "10\u00a0Then Ezra the priest stood and said to them, \u201cYou people have not been faithful to God. You have married foreign women. You have made Israel more guilty by doing that.",
  "Ezra-10-11": "11\u00a0Now you must confess your sins to the Lord, the God of your ancestors. You must obey his command. Separate yourselves from the people living around you and from your foreign wives.\u201d",
  "Ezra-10-12": "12\u00a0Then the whole group who met together answered Ezra. They shouted, \u201cEzra, you are right! We must do what you say.",
  "Ezra-10-13": "13\u00a0But there are many people here. And it is the rainy time of year, so we cannot stay outside. This problem cannot be solved in a day or two because we have sinned in a very bad way.",
  "Ezra-10-14": "14\u00a0Let our leaders decide for the whole group meeting here. Then let every man in our towns who married a foreign woman come here to Jerusalem at a planned time. Let them come here with the elders and judges of their towns. Then God will stop being angry with us.\u201d",
  "Ezra-10-15": "15\u00a0Only a few men were against this plan. They were Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah. Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite also were against the plan.",
  "Ezra-10-16": "16\u00a0So the Israelites who came back to Jerusalem accepted the plan. Ezra the priest chose men who were family leaders. He chose one man from each tribe. Each man was chosen by name. On the first day of the tenth month,[b] the men who were chosen sat down to study each of the cases.",
  "Ezra-10-17": "17\u00a0And by the first day of the first month,[c] they finished discussing all the men who had married foreign women.",
