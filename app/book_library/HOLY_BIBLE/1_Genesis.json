  "Genesis-31-13": "13\u00a0I am the God who came to you at Bethel, and there you made an altar, poured olive oil on it, and made a promise to me. Now I want you to be ready to go back to the country where you were born.\u2019\u201d",

  "Genesis-31-18": "18\u00a0Then they began traveling back to the land of Canaan, where his father lived. All the flocks of animals that Jacob owned walked ahead of them. He carried everything with him that he had gotten while he lived in Paddan Aram.",

  "Genesis-31-36": "36\u00a0Then Jacob became very angry and said, \u201cWhat wrong have I done? What law have I broken? What right do you have to chase me and stop me?",
  "Genesis-31-37": "37\u00a0You looked through everything I own and found nothing that belongs to you. If you found something, show it to me. Put it here where our men can see it. Let our men decide which one of us is right.",
  "Genesis-31-38": "38\u00a0I have worked 20 years for you. During all that time none of the baby sheep and goats died during birth. And I have not eaten any of the rams from your flocks.",
  "Genesis-31-39": "39\u00a0Any time a sheep was killed by wild animals, I always paid for the loss myself. I did not take the dead animal to you and say that it was not my fault. But I was robbed day and night.",

  "Genesis-31-41": "41\u00a0I worked 20 years like a slave for you. For the first 14 years I worked to win your two daughters. The last six years I worked to earn your animals. And during that time you changed my pay ten times.",
  "Genesis-31-42": "42\u00a0But the God of my ancestors, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac,[a] was with me. If God had not been with me, you would have sent me away with nothing. But he saw the trouble that I had and the work that I did, and last night God proved that I am right.\u201d",

  "Genesis-38-26": "26\u00a0Judah recognized these things and said, \u201cShe is right. I was wrong. I did not give her my son Shelah like I promised.\u201d And Judah did not sleep with her again.",
  "Genesis-38-27": "27\u00a0The time came for Tamar to give birth. She was going to have twins.",
  "Genesis-38-28": "28\u00a0While she was giving birth, one baby put his hand out. The nurse tied a red string on the hand and said, \u201cThis baby was born first.\u201d",
