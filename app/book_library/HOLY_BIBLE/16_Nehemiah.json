  "Nehemiah-1-1": "Nehemiah\u2019s Prayer\u00a01\u00a0These are the words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah: I, Nehemiah, was in the capital city of Susa in the month of Kislev. This was in the 20th year[a] that Artaxerxes was king.",
  "Nehemiah-1-2": "2\u00a0While I was in Susa, one of my brothers named Hanani and some other men came from Judah. I asked them about the Jews who had escaped captivity and still lived in Judah. I also asked them about the city of Jerusalem.",
  "Nehemiah-1-3": "3\u00a0They answered, \u201cNehemiah, the Jews who escaped captivity and are in the land of Judah are in much trouble. They are having many problems and are full of shame because the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.\u201d",
  "Nehemiah-1-4": "4\u00a0When I heard this about the people of Jerusalem and about the wall, I sat down and cried. I was very sad. I fasted and prayed to the God of heaven for several days.",
  "Nehemiah-1-5": "5\u00a0Then I prayed this prayer:\u00a0\u201cLord, God of heaven, you are the great and powerful God. You are the God who keeps his agreement of love with people who love you and obey your commands.",
  "Nehemiah-1-6": "6\u00a0\u201cPlease open your eyes and ears and listen to the prayer your servant is praying before you day and night. I am praying for your servants, the Israelites. I confess the sins we Israelites have done against you. I am confessing that I have sinned against you and that the other people in my father\u2019s family have sinned against you.",
  "Nehemiah-1-7": "7\u00a0We Israelites have been very bad to you. We have not obeyed the commands, rules, and laws you gave your servant Moses.",
  "Nehemiah-1-8": "8\u00a0\u201cPlease remember the teaching you gave your servant Moses. You said to him, \u2018If you Israelites are not faithful, I will force you to be scattered among the other nations.",
  "Nehemiah-1-9": "9\u00a0But if you Israelites come back to me and obey my commands, this is what I will do: Even if your people have been forced to leave their homes and go to the ends of the earth, I will gather them from there. And I will bring them back to the place I have chosen to put my name.\u2019",
  "Nehemiah-1-10": "10\u00a0\u201cThe Israelites are your servants and your people. You used your great power and rescued them.",
  "Nehemiah-1-11": "11\u00a0So, Lord, please listen to my prayer. And listen to the prayers of all your other servants who are happy to honor you. Help me today as I ask the king for help. Make him pleased with me so that he will be kind and give me what I ask for.\u201d\u00a0At that time, I was the king\u2019s wine servant.[b]",
  "Nehemiah-2-1": "The King Sends Nehemiah to Jerusalem\u00a02\u00a0In the month of Nisan in the 20th year[a] of King Artaxerxes, some wine was brought to the king. I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had never before been sad when I was with him, but now I was sad.",
  "Nehemiah-2-2": "2\u00a0So the king asked me, \u201cAre you sick? Why do you look sad? I think your heart is full of sadness.\u201d\u00a0Then I was very afraid.",
  "Nehemiah-2-3": "3\u00a0But even though I was afraid, I said to the king, \u201cMay the king live forever! I am sad because the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins, and the gates of that city have been destroyed by fire.\u201d",
  "Nehemiah-2-4": "4\u00a0Then the king said to me, \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d\u00a0Before I answered, I prayed to the God of heaven.",
  "Nehemiah-2-5": "5\u00a0Then I answered the king, \u201cIf it would please the king, and if I have been good to you, please send me to Jerusalem, the city in Judah where my ancestors are buried. I want to go there and rebuild that city.\u201d",
  "Nehemiah-2-6": "6\u00a0The king and the queen who was sitting next to him asked me, \u201cHow long will your trip take? When will you get back here?\u201d\u00a0The king was happy to send me, so I gave him a certain time.",
  "Nehemiah-2-7": "7\u00a0I also said to the king, \u201cIf it would please the king to do something else for me, let me ask. Please give me some letters to show the governors of the area west of the Euphrates River. I need these letters so that the governors will give me permission to pass safely through their lands on my way to Judah.",
  "Nehemiah-2-8": "8\u00a0I also need lumber for the heavy wooden beams for the gates, the walls, the walls around the Temple, and my house. So I need a letter from you to Asaph, who is in charge of your forests.\u201d\u00a0The king gave me the letters and everything I asked for. The king did that because my God was kind to me.",
  "Nehemiah-2-9": "9\u00a0So I went to the governors of the area west of the Euphrates River and gave them the letters from the king. The king had also sent army officers and soldiers on horses with me.",
  "Nehemiah-2-10": "10\u00a0Sanballat from Horon and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about what I was doing. They were very upset and angry that someone had come to help the Israelites.",
  "Nehemiah-2-11-Neh-2-12": "Nehemiah Inspects the Walls of Jerusalem\u00a011-12\u00a0I went to Jerusalem and stayed there three days. Then at night I started out with a few men. I had not said anything to anyone about what my God had put on my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no horses with me except the horse I was riding.",
  "Nehemiah-2-13": "13\u00a0While it was dark I went out through the Valley Gate. I rode toward the Dragon Well and the Gate of the Ash Piles. I was inspecting the walls of Jerusalem that had been broken down and the gates in the wall that had been burned with fire.",
  "Nehemiah-2-14": "14\u00a0Then I rode on toward the Fountain Gate and the King\u2019s Pool. As I got close, I could see there was not enough room for my horse to get through.",
  "Nehemiah-2-15": "15\u00a0So I went up the valley in the dark, inspecting the wall. Finally, I turned back and went back in through the Valley Gate.",
  "Nehemiah-2-16": "16\u00a0The officials and important Israelites didn\u2019t know where I had gone. They didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I had not yet said anything to the Jews, the priests, the king\u2019s family, the officials, or any of the other people who would be doing the work.",
  "Nehemiah-2-17": "17\u00a0Then I said to them, \u201cYou can see the trouble we have here: Jerusalem is a pile of ruins, and its gates have been burned with fire. Come, let\u2019s rebuild the wall of Jerusalem. Then we will not be ashamed anymore.\u201d",
  "Nehemiah-2-18": "18\u00a0I also told them that my God had been kind to me. I told them what the king had said to me. Then they answered, \u201cLet\u2019s start to work, now!\u201d So we began this good work.",
  "Nehemiah-2-19": "19\u00a0But Sanballat from Horon, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard that we were building again. They made fun of us in a very ugly way. They said, \u201cWhat are you doing? Are you turning against the king?\u201d",
  "Nehemiah-2-20": "20\u00a0But this is what I said to them: \u201cThe God of heaven will help us succeed. We are God\u2019s servants and we will rebuild this city. You cannot help us in this work because none of your family lived here in Jerusalem. You don\u2019t own any of this land, and you have no right to be in this place.\u201d",
  "Nehemiah-3-1": "Builders of the Wall\u00a03\u00a0The name of the high priest was Eliashib. He and his brothers, the priests, went to work and built the Sheep Gate.

  "Nehemiah-4-10": "10\u00a0And so at that time the people of Judah said, \u201cThe workers are becoming tired. There is too much dirt and trash in the way. We cannot continue to build the wall.",
  "Nehemiah-4-11": "11\u00a0And our enemies are saying, \u2018Before the Jews know it or see us, we will be right there among them. We will kill them and that will stop the work.\u2019\u201d",
  "Nehemiah-4-12": "12\u00a0Then the Jews living among our enemies came and said this to us ten times, \u201cOur enemies are all around us. They are everywhere we turn.\u201d",
  "Nehemiah-4-13": "13\u00a0So I put some of the people behind the lowest places along the wall, and I put them by the holes in the wall. I put families together, with their swords, spears, and bows.",

You must fight for your wives and your homes!\u201d",
  "Nehemiah-4-15": "15\u00a0Then our enemies heard that we knew about their plans. They knew that God ruined their plans. So we all went back to work on the wall. Everyone went back to their own place and did their part.",
  "Nehemiah-4-16": "16\u00a0From that day on, half of my men worked on the wall. The other half of my men were on guard, ready with spears, shields, bows, and armor. The army officers stood behind all the people of Judah who were building the wall.",

  "Nehemiah-4-18": "18\u00a0Each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked. The man who blew the trumpet to warn the people stayed next to me.",
  "Nehemiah-4-19": "19\u00a0Then I spoke to the leading families, the officials, and the rest of the people. I said, \u201cThis is a very big job and we are spread out along the wall. We are far from one another.",
  "Nehemiah-4-20": "20\u00a0So if you hear the trumpet, run to that place. We will all meet together there, and our God will fight for us!\u201d",
  "Nehemiah-4-21": "21\u00a0So we continued to work on the wall of Jerusalem, and half the men held spears. We worked from the first light of the morning until the stars came out at night.",
  "Nehemiah-4-22": "22\u00a0At that time I also said this to the people, \u201cEvery builder and his helper must stay inside Jerusalem at night. Then they can be guards at night and workers during the day.\u201d",
  "Nehemiah-4-23": "23\u00a0So none of us took off our clothes\u2014not me, not my brothers, not my men, and not the guards. Each of us had our weapon ready at all times, even when we went to get water.",
  "Nehemiah-5-1": "Nehemiah Helps the Poor\u00a05\u00a0Many of the poor people began to complain against their fellow Jews.",
  "Nehemiah-5-2": "2\u00a0Some of them were saying, \u201cWe have many children. We must get some grain if we are going to eat and stay alive.\u201d",
  "Nehemiah-5-3": "3\u00a0Other people were saying, \u201cThis is a time of famine. We have to use our fields, vineyards, and homes to pay for grain.\u201d",
  "Nehemiah-5-4": "4\u00a0And still other people were saying, \u201cWe have to pay the king\u2019s tax on our fields and vineyards. But we cannot afford to pay, so we are borrowing money to pay the tax.",
  "Nehemiah-5-5": "5\u00a0We are as good as the others. Our sons are as good as their sons. But we will have to sell our sons and daughters as slaves. Some of us have already had to sell our daughters as slaves. There is nothing we can do. We have already lost our fields and vineyards. Other people own them now.\u201d",
  "Nehemiah-5-6": "6\u00a0When I heard their complaints, I was very angry.",
  "Nehemiah-5-7": "7\u00a0I calmed myself down, and then I went to the rich families and the officials. I told them, \u201cYou are forcing your own people to pay interest on the money you loan them. You must stop doing that!\u201d Then I called for all the people to meet together",
  "Nehemiah-5-8": "8\u00a0and said to them, \u201cOur fellow Jews were sold as slaves to people in other countries. We did our best to buy them back and make them free. And now, you are selling them like slaves again!\u201d\u00a0The rich people and officials kept quiet. They could not find anything to say.",
  "Nehemiah-5-9": "9\u00a0So I continued speaking. I said, \u201cWhat you people are doing is not right! You know that you should fear and respect our God. You should not do the shameful things other people do!",
  "Nehemiah-5-10": "10\u00a0My men, my brothers, and I are also lending money and grain to the people. But let\u2019s stop forcing them to pay interest on these loans.",
  "Nehemiah-5-11": "11\u00a0You must give their fields, vineyards, olive fields, and houses back to them, right now! And you must give back the interest you charged them. You charged them one percent for the money, grain, new wine, and oil that you loaned them.\u201d",
  "Nehemiah-5-12": "12\u00a0Then the rich people and the officials said, \u201cWe will give it back and not demand anything more from them. Nehemiah, we will do as you say.\u201d\u00a0Then I called the priests. I made the rich people and the officials promise to God that they would do what they said.",
  "Nehemiah-5-13": "13\u00a0Then I shook out the folds of my clothes. I said, \u201cGod will do the same thing to everyone who does not keep their promise. God will shake them out of their houses and they will lose everything they worked for. They will lose everything!\u201d\u00a0I finished saying these things and all the people agreed. They all said, \u201cAmen\u201d and praised the Lord. So the people did as they had promised.",
  "Nehemiah-5-14": "14\u00a0And also, during the whole time that I was appointed to be governor in the land of Judah, neither my brothers nor I ate the food that was allowed for the governor. I never forced the people to pay taxes to buy my food. I was governor from the 20th year until the 32nd year that Artaxerxes was king.[a] I was governor of Judah for twelve years.",
  "Nehemiah-5-15": "15\u00a0But the governors who ruled before me made life hard for the people. The governors forced everyone to pay 1 pound[b] of silver. They also made the people give them food and wine. The leaders under these governors also ruled over the people and made life even harder. But I respected and feared God, so I didn\u2019t do things like that.",
  "Nehemiah-5-16": "16\u00a0I worked hard at building the wall of Jerusalem. All my men gathered there to work on the wall. We didn\u2019t take any land from anyone.",
  "Nehemiah-5-17": "17\u00a0Also, I regularly fed 150 Jews who were always welcome at my table, and I fed those who came to us from the nations around us.",
  "Nehemiah-5-18": "18\u00a0Every day I prepared this much food for the people who ate at my table: one ox, six good sheep, and different kinds of birds. Every ten days all kinds of wine were brought to my table. But I never demanded that they give me the food that was allowed for the governor. I knew that the work the people were doing was very hard.",
  "Nehemiah-5-19": "19\u00a0My God, remember all the good I have done for these people.",
  "Nehemiah-6-1": "More Problems\u00a06\u00a0Then Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and our other enemies heard that I had built the wall. We repaired all the holes in the wall, but we had not yet put the doors in the gates.",
  "Nehemiah-6-2": "2\u00a0So Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message: \u201cCome, Nehemiah, let\u2019s meet together. We can meet in the town of Kephirim on the plain of Ono.\u201d But they were planning to hurt me.",
  "Nehemiah-6-3": "3\u00a0So I sent messengers to them with this answer: \u201cI am doing important work, so I cannot come down. I don\u2019t want the work to stop just so I can come down and meet with you.\u201d",
  "Nehemiah-6-4": "4\u00a0Sanballat and Geshem sent the same message to me four times, and I sent the same answer back to them each time.",
  "Nehemiah-6-5": "5\u00a0Then, the fifth time, Sanballat sent his helper to me with the same message. And he had a letter in his hand that was not sealed.",
  "Nehemiah-6-6": "6\u00a0This is what the letter said:\u00a0\u201cThere is a rumor going around. People are talking about it everywhere. And, by the way, Geshem says it is true. People are saying that you and the Jews are planning to turn against the king. This is why you are building the wall of Jerusalem. People are also saying that you will be the new king of the Jews.",
  "Nehemiah-6-7": "7\u00a0And the rumor is that you have chosen prophets to announce this about you in Jerusalem: \u2018There is a king in Judah!\u2019\u00a0\u201cNow I warn you, Nehemiah, King Artaxerxes will hear about this. So come, let\u2019s meet and talk about this together.\u201d",
  "Nehemiah-6-8": "8\u00a0So I sent this answer back to Sanballat: \u201cNothing you are saying is happening. You are just making all that up in your own head.\u201d",
  "Nehemiah-6-9": "9\u00a0Our enemies were only trying to make us afraid. They are thinking to themselves, \u201cThe Jews will be afraid and too weak to keep on working. Then the wall will not be finished.\u201d\u00a0But I prayed, \u201cGod, make me strong.\u201d",
  "Nehemiah-6-10": "10\u00a0One day I went to the house of a man named Shemaiah son of Delaiah. Delaiah was the son of Mehetabel. Shemaiah had to stay in his house. He said, \u201cNehemiah, let\u2019s meet in God\u2019s Temple. Let\u2019s go inside the Holy Place[a] and lock the doors. Men are coming to kill you. Tonight they are coming to kill you.\u201d",
  "Nehemiah-6-11": "11\u00a0But I said to Shemaiah, \u201cShould a man like me run away? You know that an ordinary man like me cannot go into the Holy Place without being put to death. I will not go!\u201d",
  "Nehemiah-6-12": "12\u00a0I knew that God had not sent Shemaiah. I knew that he had prophesied against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had paid him to do that.",

  "Nehemiah-6-15": "The Wall Is Finished\u00a015\u00a0So the wall of Jerusalem was completed on the 25th day of the month of Elul.[b] It had taken 52 days to finish building the wall.",
  "Nehemiah-6-16": "16\u00a0Then all our enemies heard that we had completed the wall, and all the nations around us saw that it was finished. So they lost their courage, because they understood that this work had been done with the help of our God.",
  "Nehemiah-6-17": "17\u00a0Also in those days after the wall had been completed, the rich people of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah, and he was answering their letters.",
  "Nehemiah-6-18": "18\u00a0They sent those letters because many people in Judah had promised to be loyal to him. The reason for this is that Tobiah was son-in-law to Shecaniah son of Arah. And Tobiah\u2019s son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam. Meshullam is the son of Berekiah.",
  "Nehemiah-6-19": "19\u00a0And in the past, those people had made a special promise to Tobiah. So they kept telling me how good Tobiah was. And they kept telling Tobiah what I was doing. Tobiah kept sending me letters to make me afraid.",
  "Nehemiah-7-1": "7\u00a0After we finished building the wall and put the doors in the gates, we chose the men who would guard the gates and the men to sing in the Temple and help the priests.",
  "Nehemiah-7-2": "2\u00a0Next, I put my brother Hanani in charge of Jerusalem. I chose another man named Hananiah to be the commander of the fort. I picked Hanani because he was a very honest man and he feared God more than most people do.",
  "Nehemiah-7-3": "3\u00a0Then I said to Hanani and Hananiah, \u201cEach day you must wait until the sun has been up for several hours before you open the gates of Jerusalem. You must shut and lock the gates before the sun goes down. Also choose people who live in Jerusalem as guards. Put some of them at special places to guard the city, and put the other people near their own houses.\u201d",
  "Nehemiah-7-4": "The List of Captives Who Returned\u00a04\u00a0Now the city was large and there was plenty of room. But there were few people in it, and the houses had not yet been rebuilt.",
  "Nehemiah-7-5": "5\u00a0So my God put it in my heart to have all the people meet together. I called together all the important people, the officials, and the common people. I did this so that I could make a list of all the families. I found the family lists[a] of the people who had been the first to return from captivity. This is what I found written there:",
  "Nehemiah-7-6": "6\u00a0These are the people of the province who came back from captivity. In the past, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took them as prisoners to Babylon. These people came back to Jerusalem and Judah. They all went to their own towns.",

  "Nehemiah-13-1": "Nehemiah\u2019s Last Commands\u00a013\u00a0On that day the Book of Moses was read out loud, so that all the people could hear. They found this law written there: No Ammonite and no Moabite would be permitted to join in the meetings with God.",
  "Nehemiah-13-2": "2\u00a0That law was written because those people didn\u2019t give the Israelites food and water. And they had paid Balaam to say a curse against the Israelites. But our God changed that curse and made it a blessing for us.",

  "Nehemiah-13-4-Neh-13-5": "4-5\u00a0But, before that happened, Eliashib had given a room in the Temple to Tobiah. Eliashib was the priest in charge of the storerooms in our God\u2019s Temple. And he was a close friend of Tobiah. That room had been used for storing the grain offerings, incense, and the Temple dishes and things. They also kept the tenth of grain, new wine, and oil for the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers in that room. And they also kept the gifts for the priests in that room. But Eliashib gave that room to Tobiah.",
  "Nehemiah-13-6": "6\u00a0I was not in Jerusalem while all of this was happening. I had gone back to the king of Babylon. I went back to Babylon in the 32nd year that Artaxerxes was king of Babylon.[a] Later, I asked the king for permission to go back to Jerusalem.",
  "Nehemiah-13-7": "7\u00a0So I came back to Jerusalem. There I heard about the sad thing that Eliashib had done. He had given Tobiah a room in the Temple of God!",
  "Nehemiah-13-8": "8\u00a0I was very angry about what Eliashib had done, so I threw all of Tobiah\u2019s things out of the room.",
  "Nehemiah-13-9": "9\u00a0I gave commands for the rooms to be made pure and clean. Then I put the Temple dishes and things, the grain offerings, and the incense back into the rooms.",
  "Nehemiah-13-10": "10\u00a0I also heard that the people had not given the Levites their share. So the Levites and singers had gone back to work in their own fields.",
  "Nehemiah-13-11": "11\u00a0So I told the officials that they were wrong. I asked them, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you take care of God\u2019s Temple?\u201d Then I called all Levites together and told them to go back to their places and duties in the Temple.",
  "Nehemiah-13-12": "12\u00a0Then everyone in Judah brought their tenth of grain, new wine, and oil to the Temple. These things were put into the storerooms.",
  "Nehemiah-13-13": "13\u00a0I put these men in charge of the storerooms: Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the teacher, and a Levite named Pedaiah. And I made Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, their helper. I knew I could trust these men. They were responsible for giving the supplies to their relatives.",
  "Nehemiah-13-14": "14\u00a0My God, please remember me for these things I have done. Don\u2019t forget all I have faithfully done for the Temple of my God and for its services.",
  "Nehemiah-13-15": "15\u00a0In those days in Judah, I saw people working on the Sabbath day. I saw people pressing grapes to make wine. I saw people bringing in grain and loading it on donkeys. I saw people carrying grapes, figs, and all kinds of things in the city. They were bringing all these things into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, so I warned them about this. I told them they must not sell food on the Sabbath day.",
  "Nehemiah-13-16": "16\u00a0There were some men from the city of Tyre living in Jerusalem. They were bringing fish and all kinds of things into Jerusalem and selling them on the Sabbath day. And the Jews were buying them.",
  "Nehemiah-13-17": "17\u00a0I told the important people of Judah that they were wrong. I said, \u201cYou are doing a very bad thing. You are ruining the Sabbath day.",
  "Nehemiah-13-18": "18\u00a0You know that your ancestors did the same things. That is why our God brought all the troubles and disaster to us and to this city. Now you people are making it so that more of these bad things will happen to Israel. They are doing this because you are breaking the Sabbath by treating it just as if it were any other day.\u201d",
  "Nehemiah-13-19": "19\u00a0So this is what I did: Every Friday evening, just before dark, I commanded the gatekeepers to shut and lock the gates to Jerusalem. They were not to be opened until the Sabbath day was over. I put some of my own men at the gates. They were commanded to make sure that no load was brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day.",
  "Nehemiah-13-20": "20\u00a0One or two times, traders and merchants had to stay the night outside Jerusalem.",
  "Nehemiah-13-21": "21\u00a0But I warned them, \u201cDon\u2019t stay the night in front of the wall. If you do that again, I will arrest you.\u201d So from that time on they didn\u2019t come on the Sabbath day to sell their things.",
  "Nehemiah-13-22": "22\u00a0Then I commanded the Levites to make themselves pure. After they did that, they were to go and guard the gates. This was done to make sure the Sabbath day was kept a holy day.\u00a0My God, please remember me for doing this. Be kind to me and show me your great love!",
  "Nehemiah-13-23": "23\u00a0In those days I also noticed that some Jewish men had married women from the countries of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab.",
  "Nehemiah-13-24": "24\u00a0And half of the children from those marriages didn\u2019t know how to speak the Jewish language. They spoke the language of Ashdod, Ammon, or Moab.",
  "Nehemiah-13-25": "25\u00a0So I told the men that they were wrong. I said bad things to them. I hit some of them, and I pulled out their hair. I forced them to make a promise in God\u2019s name. I said to them, \u201cYou must not marry the daughters of these foreigners. Don\u2019t let their daughters marry your sons, and don\u2019t let your daughters marry the sons of these foreigners.",
  "Nehemiah-13-26": "26\u00a0You know that marriages like this caused Solomon to sin. In all the many nations, there was not a king as great as Solomon. God loved him and made him king over the whole nation of Israel. But even Solomon was made to sin because of foreign women.",
  "Nehemiah-13-27": "27\u00a0And now, we hear that you also are doing this terrible sin. You are not being true to our God. You are marrying foreign women.\u201d",
  "Nehemiah-13-28": "28\u00a0Joiada was the son of Eliashib the high priest. One of Joiada\u2019s sons was a son-in-law of Sanballat from Horon. I forced him to leave this place. I forced him to run away.",
  "Nehemiah-13-29": "29\u00a0My God, punish these people. They made the priesthood unclean. They treated it as if it was not important. They did not obey the agreement that you made with the priests and Levites.",
  "Nehemiah-13-30": "30\u00a0So I made the priests and Levites clean and pure. I took away all the foreigners and the strange things they taught. And I gave the Levites and priests their own duties and responsibilities.",
  "Nehemiah-13-31": "31\u00a0And I made sure that people will bring gifts of wood and the first part of their harvest at the right times.\u00a0My God, remember me for doing these good things."
